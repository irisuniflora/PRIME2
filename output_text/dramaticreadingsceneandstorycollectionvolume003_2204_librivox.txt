knights and ladies elves and pages monks and flower-girls all mingled gaily in the dance sweet voices and rich melody filled the air and so with mirth and music the masquerade went on has your highness seen the lady viola to-night asked a gallant troubadour of the fairy queen who floated down the hall upon his arm yes is she not lovely though so sad her dress is well chosen too for in a week she weds count antonio whom she passionately hates
by my faith i envy him yonder he comes arrayed like a bridegroom except the black mask when that is off we shall see how he regards the fair maid whose heart he cannot win though her stern father bestows her hand returned the troubadour tis whispered that she loves the young english artist who haunts her steps and is spurned by the old count said the lady as they joined the dance the revel was at its height when a priest appeared
withdrawing the young pair to an alcove hung with purple velvet he motioned them to kneel instant silence fell on the gay throng and not a sound but the dash of fountains or the rustle of orange-groves sleeping in the moonlight broke the hush as count d'adelon spoke thus my lords and ladies pardon the ruse by which i have gathered you here till we witness the marriage of my daughter father we wait your services
all eyes turned toward the bridal party and a murmur of amazement went through the throng for neither bride nor groom removed their masks curiosity and wonder possessed all hearts but respect restrained all tongues till the holy rite was over then the eager spectators gathered round the count demanding an explanation gladly i would give it if i could but i only know that it was the whim of my timid viola and i yield to it
and now my children i let the play end on the mask and the receiver my blessing but neither bent the knee for the young bridegroom replied in a tone that startled all listeners as the mask fell disclosing the noble face of ferdinand devereux the artist lover and leaning on the breast where now flashed the star of an english earl was the lovely viola radiant with joy and beauty
my lord you scornfully bade me claim your daughter when i could boast as high a name and vast a fortune as the count antonio i can do more for even your ambitious soul cannot refuse the earl of devereux and de vere when he gives his ancient name and boundless wealth in return for the beloved hand of this fair lady now my wife the count stood like one changed to stone and turning to the bewildered crowd
ferdinand added with a gay smile of triumph to you my gallant friends i can only wish that your wooing may prosper as mine has done and that you may all win as fair a bride as i have by this masked marriage s pickwick the masked marriage

anne blythe shirley read by michelle eaton barriers swept away anne said leslie breaking abruptly a short silence you don't know how good it is to be sitting here with you again working and talking and being silent together they were sitting among the blue-eyed grasses on the bank of the brook in anne's garden the water sparkled and crooned past them the birches threw dappled shadows over them roses bloomed along the walks
the sun was beginning to be low and the air was full of woven music there was one music of the wind in the firs behind the house and another of the waves on the bar and still another from the distant bell of the church near which the wee white lady slept anne loved that bell though it brought sorrowful thoughts now she looked curiously at leslie who had thrown down her sewing and spoken with a lack of restraint that was very unusual with her on that horrible night when you were so ill leslie went on
i kept thinking that perhaps we'd have no more talks and walks and works together and i realized just what your friendship has come to mean to me just what you meant and just what a hateful little beast i have been leslie leslie i never allow any one to call my friends names it's true that's exactly what i am a hateful little beast there's something i've got to tell you anne i suppose it will make you despise me but i must confess it anne there have been times this past winter and spring when i have hated you
i knew it said anne calmly you knew it yes i saw it in your eyes and yet you went on liking me and being my friend well it was only now and then you hated me leslie between times you loved me i think
i certainly did but that other horrid feeling was always there spoiling it back in my heart i kept it down sometimes i forgot it but sometimes it would surge up and take possession of me i hated you because i envied you oh i was sick with envy of you at times you had a dear little home and love and happiness and glad dreams everything i wanted and never had and never could have oh never could have that was what stung
I wouldn't have envied you if I had had any hope that life would ever be different from me, but I hadn't. I hadn't, and it didn't seem fair. It made me rebellious, and it hurt me, and so I hated you at times. Oh, I was so ashamed of it. I'm dying of shame now, but I couldn't conquer it. That night when I was afraid you mightn't live, I thought I was going to be punished for my wickedness, and I loved you so then, Anne. Anne, I never had anything to love since my mother died, except Dick's old dog, and it's so dreadful to have nothing to love. Life is
so empty and there's nothing worse than emptiness and i might have loved you so much and that horrible thing had spoiled it leslie was trembling and growing almost incoherent with the violence of her emotion don't leslie implored anne oh don't i understand don't talk of it any more
i must i must when i knew you were going to live i vowed that i would tell you as soon as you were well that i wouldn't go on accepting your friendship and companionship without telling you how unworthy i was of it and i've been so afraid it would turn you against me you needn't fear that leslie oh i'm so glad so glad anne leslie clasped her brown work-hardened hands tightly together to still their shaking but i want to tell you everything now i've begun you don't remember the first time i saw you i suppose
it wasn't that night on the shore no it was the night gilbert and i came home you were driving your geese down the hill i should think i do remember it i thought you were so beautiful i longed for weeks after to find out who you were i knew who you were although i had never seen either of you before i had heard of the new doctor and his bride who were coming to live in miss russell's little house i-i hated you that very moment in i felt the resentment in your eyes
then i doubted i thought i must be mistaken because why should it be it was because you looked so happy oh you'll agree with me now that i am a hateful beast to hate another woman just because she was happy and when her happiness didn't take anything from me
that was why i never went to see you i knew quite well i ought to go even our simple four winds customs demanded that but i couldn't i used to watch you from my window i could see you and your husband strolling about your garden in the evening or you running down the poplar lane to meet him and it hurt me and yet in another way i wanted to go over i felt that if i were not so miserable i could have liked you and found in you what i've never had in my life an intimate real friend of my own age and then you remember that night at the shore
you were afraid i would think you crazy you must have thought i was no but i couldn't understand you leslie one moment you drew me to you the next you pushed me back i was very unhappy that evening i had had a hard day dick had been very
very hard to manage that day generally he is quite good-natured and easily controlled you know anne but some days he is very different i was so heartsick i ran away to the shore as soon as he went to sleep it was my only refuge i sat there thinking of how my poor father had ended his life and wondering if i wouldn't be driven to it some day oh my heart was full of black thoughts and then you came dancing along the cove like a glad light-hearted child
i hated you more then than i'd ever done since and yet i craved your friendship the one feeling swayed me one moment the other feeling the next when i got home that night i cried for shame of what you must think of me but it's always been the same when i came over here sometimes i'd be happy and enjoy my visit and at other times that hideous feeling would mar it all there were times when everything about you and your house hurt me you had so many dear little things i couldn't have
do you know it's ridiculous but i had an especial spite at those china dogs of yours there were times when i wanted to catch up gog and magog and bang their purplack noses together oh you smile anne but it was never funny to me i would come here and see you and gilbert with your books and your flowers and your household gods and your little family jokes and your love for each other showing in every look and word even when you didn't know it and i would go home to
you know what i went home to oh anne i don't believe i'm jealous and envious by nature when i was a girl i lacked many things my schoolmates had but i never cared i never disliked them for it but i seem to have grown so hateful leslie dearest stop blaming yourself you are not hateful or jealous or envious the life you have to live has warped you a little perhaps but it would have ruined a nature less fine and noble than yours
i am letting you tell me all this because i believe it's better for you to talk it out and rid your soul of it but don't blame yourself any more
well i won't i just wanted you to know me as i am that time you told me of your darling hope for the spring was the worst of all anne i shall never forgive myself for the way i behaved then i repented it with tears and i did put many a tender and loving thought of you into the little dress i made but i might have known that anything i made could only be a shroud in the end now leslie that is bitter and morbid put such thoughts away i was so glad when you brought the little dress
and since i had to lose little joyce i like to think that the dress she wore was the one you made for her when you let yourself love me anne do you know i believe i shall always love you after this i don't think i'll ever feel that dreadful way about you again talking it all out seems to have done away with it somehow it's very strange and i thought it so real and bitter
it's like opening the door of a dark room to show some hideous creature you've believed to be there and when the light streams in your monster turns out to have been just a shadow vanishing when the light comes it will never come between us again no we are real friends now leslie and i am very glad i hope you won't misunderstand me if i say something else anne i was grief to the core of my heart when you lost your baby and if i could have saved her for you by cutting off one of my hands i would have done it
but your sorrow has brought us closer together your perfect happiness isn't a barrier any longer oh don't misunderstand dearest i'm not glad that your happiness isn't perfect any longer i can say that sincerely but since it isn't there isn't such a gulf between us i do understand that too leslie now we'll just shut up the past and forget what was unpleasant in it it's all going to be different we're both of the race of joseph now i think you've been wonderful wonderful and leslie
I can't help believing that life has something good and beautiful for you yet. Leslie shook her head. No, she said dully. There isn't any hope. Dick will never be better. And even if his memory were to come back, oh, Anne, it would be worse, even worse than it is now. This is something you can't understand, you happy bride. Anne, did Miss Cornelia ever tell you how I came to marry Dick? Yes. I'm glad. I wanted you to know, but I couldn't bring myself to talk of it if you hadn't known.
anne it seems to me that ever since i was twelve years old life has been bitter before that i had a happy childhood we were very poor but we didn't mind father was so splendid so clever and loving and sympathetic we were chums as far back as i can remember and mother was so sweet she was very very beautiful i look like her but i am not so beautiful as she was miss cornelia says you are far more beautiful she is mistaken or prejudiced
i think my figure is better mother was slight and bent by hard work but she had the face of an angel i used just to look up at her in worship we all worshipped her father and kenneth and i anne remembered that miss cornelia had given her a very different impression of leslie's mother but had not loved the truer vision still it was selfish of rose west to make her daughter marry dick moore kenneth was my brother went on leslie oh i can't tell you how i loved him and he was cruelly killed
do you know how yes anne i saw his little face as the wheel went over him he fell on his back anne anne i can see it now i shall always see it anne all i ask of heaven is that that recollection shall be blotted out of my memory oh my god leslie don't speak of it i know the story don't go into details that only harrow your soul up unavailingly it will be blotted out after a moment's struggle
leslie regained a measure of self-control then father's health got worse and he grew despondent his mind became unbalanced you've heard all that too yes
after that i had just mother to live for but i was very ambitious i meant to teach and earn my way through college i meant to climb to the very top oh i won't talk of that either it's no use you know what happened i couldn't see my dear little heart-broken mother who had been such a slave all her life turned out of her home of course i could have earned enough for us to live on but mother couldn't leave her home she had come there as a bride and she had loved father so and all her memories were there even yet anne when i think that i made her last year happy i'm not sorry for what i did
as for dick i didn't hate him when i married him i just felt for him the indifferent friendly feeling i had for most of my schoolmates i knew he drank some but i had never heard the story of the girl down at the fishing cove if i had i couldn't have married him even for mother's sake afterwards i did hate him but mother never knew she died and then i was alone i was only seventeen and i was alone dick had gone off in the four sisters i hoped he wouldn't be home very much more the sea had always been in his blood
i had no other hope well captain jim brought him home as you know and that's all there is to say you know me now anne the worst of me the barriers are all down and you still want to be my friend anne looked up through the birches at the white paper lantern of a half-moon drifting downwards to the gulf of sunset her face was very sweet i am your friend and you are mine for always she said such a friend as i never had before i have had many dear and beloved friends
but there is a something in you leslie that i never found in any one else you have more to offer me in that rich nature of yours and i have more to give you than i had in my careless girlhood we are both women and friends for ever they clasped hands and smiled at each other through the tears that filled the grey eyes and the blue chapter twenty one of

read by wayne cook door mouse read by jen broda narrator read by peter yearsley there was a table set out under a tree in front of the house and the march hare and the hatter were having tea at it a dormouse was sitting between them fast asleep and the other two were using it as a cushion resting their elbows on it and talking over its head very uncomfortable for the dormouse
thought alice only as it's asleep i suppose it doesn't mind the table was a large one but the three were all crowded together at one corner of it they cried out when they saw alice coming there's plenty of room said alice indignantly and she sat down in a large arm-chair at one end of the table have some wine
the march hare said in an encouraging tone alice looked all round the table but there was nothing on it but tea i don't see any wine she remarked there isn't any said the march hare then it wasn't very civil of you to offer it said alice angrily wasn't very civil of you to sit down without being invited said the march hare i didn't know it was your table said alice
it's laid for a great many more than three you're here once cutting said the hatter he had been looking at alice for some time with great curiosity and this was his first speech you should learn not to make personal remarks alice said with some severity it's very rude the hatter opened his eyes very wide on hearing this but all he said was
why is a raven like a writing-desk come we shall have some fun now thought alice i'm glad they've begun asking riddles i believe i can guess that she added aloud do you mean that you think you can find out the answer to it said the march hare exactly so said alice then you should say what you mean the march hare went on i do alice hastily replied at least
at least i mean what i say that's the same thing you know not the same thing a bit said the hatter you might as well say that i see what i eat is the same thing as i eat what i see you might just as well say added the march hare that i like what i get is the same thing as i get what i like you might just as well say added the dormouse who seemed to be talking in his sleep
that i breathe when i sleep is the same thing as i sleep when i breathe it is the same thing with you said the hatter and here the conversation dropped and the party sat silent for a minute while alice thought over all she could remember about ravens and writing desks which wasn't much the hatter was the first to break the silence what day of the month is it
he said turning to alice he had taken his watch out of his pocket and was looking at it uneasily shaking it every now and then and holding it to his ear alice considered a little and then said the fourth ha two days wrong sighed the hatter i told you but it wouldn't suit the works he added looking angrily at the march hare it was the best
the march hare meekly replied yes but some crumbs must have got in as well the hatter grumbled you shouldn't have put it in with the bread-knife the march hare took the watch and looked at it gloomily then he dipped it into his cup of tea and looked at it again but he could think of nothing better to say than his first remark it was the best platter you know
alice had been looking over his shoulder with some curiosity what a funny watch she remarked it tells the day of the month and doesn't tell what o'clock it is why sell it muttered the hatter does your watch tell you what year it is of course not alice replied very readily but that's because it stays the same year for such a long time together which is just the case with mine said the hatter
alice felt dreadfully puzzled the hatter's remark seemed to have no sort of meaning in it and yet it was certainly english i don't quite understand you she said as politely as she could the dormouse is asleep again said the hatter and he poured a little hot tea upon its nose the dormouse shook its head impatiently and said without opening its eyes course of course
just what i was going to remark myself have you guessed the widow yet the hatter said turning to alice again no i give it up alice replied what's the answer i haven't the slightest idea said the hatter nor i said the march hare alice sighed wearily i think you might do something better with the time she said
then wasted in asking riddles that have no answers if you do time as well as i do said the hatter you wouldn't talk about wasting it it's him i don't know what you mean said alice of course you don't the hatter said tossing his head contemptuously i dare say you never even spoke to time perhaps not alice cautiously replied but i know i have to beat time when i learn music
ah that accounts for it said the hatter he won't stand beating now if you only kept on good terms with him he'd do almost anything you liked with the clock for instance suppose it was nine o'clock in the morning just in time to begin lessons you'd only have to whisper a little hint to time and round goes the clock in a clink clink half-past one time for dinner i only wish it was the march hare said to itself in a whisper
be grand certainly said alice thoughtfully but then i shouldn't be hungry for it you know not at first perhaps said the hatter but you could keep it to half-past one as long as you liked is that the way you manage alice asked the hatter shook his head mournfully not i he replied we crawled last month just before he went mad you know
pointing with his teaspoon at the march hare it was at the great concert given by the queen of hearts and i had to sing twinkle twinkle little bat how i wonder what you're at you know the songs perhaps i've heard something like it said alice it goes on you know the hatter continued in this way up up up so will you fly like a tea-tray in the sky twinkle twinkle
here the dormouse shook itself and began singing in its sleep twinkle twinkle twinkle twinkle and went on so long that they had to pinch it to make it stop well i'd hardly finish the first verse said the hatter when the queen jumps up and bawls out he's murdering the time off with his head how dreadfully savage
exclaimed alice and ever since that the hatter went on in a mournful tone he won't do a thing i ask it's always six o'clock now a bright idea came into alice's head is that the reason so many tea-things are put out here she asked yes that's it said the hatter with a sigh it's always tea-time you have no time to watch the things between whiles then you keep moving round i suppose
said alice exactly so said the hatter as the things get used up but what happens when you come to the beginning again alice ventured to ask suppose we change the subject the march hare interrupted yawning i'm getting tired of this i vote the young lady tell us a story i'm afraid i don't know one said alice rather alarmed at the proposal
then the dormouse shall they both cried wake up dormouse and they pinched it on both sides at once the dormouse slowly opened his eyes i wasn't asleep he said in a hoarse feeble voice i heard every word you fellows were saying tell us a story said the march hare yes please do pleaded alice
and be quick about this added the hatter or you'll be asleep again before it's done once upon a time there were three little sisters the dormouse began in a great hurry and their names were elsie lacy and tillie and they lived at the bottom of a well what did they live on said alice who always took a great interest in questions of eating and drinking they lived on treacle said the dormouse after thinking a minute or two
they couldn't have done that you know alice gently remarked they'd have been ill so they were said the dormouse very ill alice tried to fancy to herself what such an extraordinary way of living would be like but it puzzled her too much so she went on but why did they live at the bottom of a well take some more tea
the march hare said to alice very earnestly i've had nothing yet alice replied in an offended tone so i can't take more you mean you can't take less said the hatter it's very easy to take more than nothing nobody asked your opinion said alice who's making personal remarks now the hatter asked triumphantly
alice did not quite know what to say to this so she helped herself to some tea and bread and butter and then turned to the dormouse and repeated her question why did they live at the bottom of a well the dormouse again took a minute or two to think about it and then said it was a treacle well there's no such thing alice was beginning very angrily but the hatter and the march hare went
and the dormouse sulkily remarked if you can't be civil you'd better finish the story for yourself no please go on alice said very humbly i won't interrupt again i dare say there may be one one indeed said the dormouse indignantly however he consented to go on and so these three little sisters
they were learning to draw you know what did they draw said alice quite forgetting her promise treacle said the dormouse without considering at all this time i want a clean cup interrupted the hatter let's all move one place on he moved on as he spoke and the dormouse followed him the march hare moved into the dormouse's place and alice rather unwillingly
took the place of the march hare the hatter was the only one who got any advantage from the change and alice was a good deal worse off than before as the march hare had just upset the milk-jug into his plate alice did not wish to offend the dormouse again so she began very cautiously but i don't understand where did they draw the treacle from you can draw water out of a water-well said the hatter
so i should think you could draw a trickle out of a trickle well eh stupid but they were in the well alice said to the dormouse not choosing to notice this last remark of course they were said the dormouse well in this answer so confused poor alice that she let the dormouse go on for some time without interrupting it they were learning to draw
the dormouse went on yawning and rubbing its eyes for it was getting very sleepy and they drew all manner of things everything that begins with an m why with an m said alice why not said the march hare alice was silent the dormouse had closed its eyes by this time and was going off into a doze but on being pinched by the hatter
it woke up again with a little shriek and went on that begins with an m such as mouse-traps and the moon and memory and muchness you know they say things are much of a muchness did you ever see such a thing as a drawing of a muchness really now you ask me said alice very much confused don't think then you shouldn't talk said the hatter
this piece of rudeness was more than alice could bear she got up in great disgust and walked off the dormouse fell asleep instantly and neither of the others took the least notice of her going though she looked back once or twice half hoping that they would call after her the last time she saw them they were trying to put the dormouse into the teapot at any rate i'll never go there again
said alice as she picked her way through the wood it's the stupidest tea-party i ever was at in all my life just as she said this she noticed that one of the trees had a door leading right into it that's very curious she thought but everything's curious to-day i think i may as well go in at once and in she went once more she found herself in the long hall
and close to the little glass table now i'll manage better this time she said to herself and began by taking the little golden key and unlocking the door that led into the garden then she went to work nibbling at the mushroom she had kept a piece of it in her pocket till she was about a foot high then she walked down the little passage and then she found herself at last in the beautiful garden
Among the bright flower-beds and the cool fountains. End of A Mad Tea Party

boy read by greg giordano the young lady read by book three sixty robert ashburton read by wayne cook it was neither the season nor the hour when the park had frequenters and it is likely that the young lady who was seated on one of the benches at the side of the walk had merely obeyed a sudden impulse to sit for a while and enjoy a foretaste of coming spring she rested there pensive and still
a certain melancholy that touched her countenance must have been of recent birth for it had not yet altered the fine and youthful contours of her cheek nor subdued the arch though resolute curve of her lips a tall young man came striding through the park along the path near which she sat behind him tagged a boy carrying a suit-case at sight of the young lady the man's face changed to red and back to pale again
he watched her countenance as he drew nearer with hope and anxiety mingled on his own he passed within a few yards of her but he saw no evidence that she was aware of his presence or existence some fifty yards further on he suddenly stopped and sat on a bench at one side the boy dropped the suitcase and stared at him with wondering shrewd eyes the young man took out his handkerchief and wiped his brow it was a good handkerchief a good brow and the young man was good to look at
he said to the boy i want you to take a message to that young lady on that bench tell her i am on my way to the station to leave for san francisco where i shall join that alaska moose-hunting expedition tell her that since she has commanded me neither to speak nor to write to her i take this means of making one last appeal to her sense of justice for the sake of what has been tell her
that to condemn and discard one who has not deserved such treatment without giving him her reasons or a chance to explain is contrary to her nature as i believe it to be tell her that i have thus to a certain degree disobeyed her injunctions in the hope that she may yet be inclined to see justice done go and tell her that the young man dropped a half-dollar into the boy's hand
the boy looked at him for a moment with bright canny eyes out of a dirty intelligent face and then set off at a run he approached the lady on the bench a little doubtfully but unembarrassed he touched the brim of the old plaid bicycle cap perched on the back of his head the lady looked at him coolly without prejudice or favor lady he said dat gent on dat odder bench sent yer a song an dance by me if yer don't know de guy
an he's tryin to do de johnny act say de word an i'll call cop in three minutes if yer does know im an he's on de square why i'll spiel yer de bunch o hot air he sent yer the young lady betrayed a faint interest a song and dance she said in a deliberate sweet voice that seemed to clothe her words in a diaphanous garment of impalpable irony
a new idea in the troubadour line i suppose i used to know the gentleman who sent you so i think it will hardly be necessary to call the police you may execute your song and dance but do not sing too loudly it is a little early yet for open-air vaudeville and we might attract attention aw said the boy with a shrug down the length of him yer know what i mean lady tain't a turn it's wind he told me to tell yer he's got his
collars and cuffs and dat grip for a scoot clean out to frisco then he's goin to shoot snowbirds into klondike he says yer told him not to send round no more pink notes nor come hangin over the garden gate and he takes this means of puttin yer wise he says yer refereed him out like a has-been and never give him no chance to kick at the decision he says yer swiped him and never said why
the slightly awakened interest in the young lady's eyes did not abate perhaps it was caused by either the originality or the audacity of the snowbird hunter in thus circumventing her express commands against the ordinary modes of communication she fixed her eye on a statue standing disconsolate in the dishevelled park and spoke into the transmitter
tell the gentleman that i need not repeat to him a description of my ideals he knows what they have been and what they still are so far as they touch on this case absolute loyalty and truth are the ones paramount tell him that i have studied my own heart as well as one can and i know its weaknesses as well as i do its needs that is why i decline to hear his pleas whatever they may be i did not condemn him through hearsay or doubtful evidence and that is why i made no charge but since he persists in hearing what he already well knows you may convey that matter
tell him i entered the conservatory that evening from the rear to cut a rose for my mother tell him i saw him and miss ashburton behind the pink oleander the tableau was pretty but the pose and juxtaposition were too eloquent and evident to require explanation i left the conservatory and at the same time the rose and my ideal you may carry that song and dance to your impresario i'm shy on one word lady
puts me wise on doubt will yer juxtaposition or you may call it propinquity or if you like being rather too near for one maintaining the position of an ideal the gravel spun from beneath the boy's feet he stood by the other bench the man's eyes interrogated him hungrily the boys were shining with the impersonal zeal of the translator the lady says that she's on to the fact that gals is dead easy when a feller comes spielin ghost stories
an tryin to make up an that's why she won't listen to no soft soap she says you caught your dead to rights hookin a bunch o calico in de hot-house she side-stepped in to pull some posies an yer was squeezin de older gal to beat de band she says it looked cute all right all right but they made her sick she says yer better git busy an make a sneak for de train
the young man gave a low whistle and his eyes flashed with a sudden thought his hand flew to the inside pocket of his coat and drew out a handful of letters selecting one he handed it to the boy following it with a silver dollar from his vest pocket give that letter to the lady he said and ask her to read it tell her that it should explain the situation tell her that if she had mingled a little trust with her conception of the ideal
much heartache might have been avoided tell her that the loyalty she prizes so much has never wavered tell her i am waiting for an answer the messenger stood before the lady de gent says he's had de ski bunk put on him without no cause he says he's no bum guy an lady yer read dat letter an i'll bet yer he's a white sport all right the young lady unfolded the letter somewhat doubtfully
and read it dear dr arnold i want to thank you for your most kind and opportune aid to my daughter last friday evening when she was overcome by an attack of her old heart trouble in the conservatory at mrs waldron's reception had you not been near to catch her she fell and to render proper attention we might have lost her i would be glad if you would call and undertake the treatment of her case gratefully yours robert
ashburton the young lady refolded the letter and handed it to the boy the gent wants an answer said the messenger what's de word the lady's eyes suddenly flashed on him bright smiling and wet tell that guy on the other bench she said with a happy tremulous laugh that his girl wants him by courier

the next morning at sunrise monseigneur bienvenu was strolling in his garden madame magloire ran up to him in utter consternation monseigneur monseigneur she exclaimed does your grace know where the basket of silver is yes replied the bishop ah je sue the lord be blest she resumed i did not know what had become of it the bishop had just picked up the basket in a flower bed
he presented it to madame magloire here it is well said she nothing in it and the silver ah returned the bishop so it is the silver which troubles you i don't know where it is great good god it is stolen the man who was here last night has stolen it in a twinkling with all the vivacity of an alert old woman
madame magloire had rushed to the oratory entered the alcove and returned to the bishop the bishop had just bent down and was sighing as he examined a plant of cochlear which the basket had broken as it fell across the bed he rose up at madame magloire's cry monseigneur the man is gone the silver has been stolen as she uttered this exclamation her eyes fell upon a corner of the garden
where traces of the wall having been scaled were visible the coping of the wall had been torn away stay yonder is the way that he went he jumped over into the couchville lane ah the abomination he has stolen our silver the bishop remained silent for a moment then he raised his grave eyes and said gently to madame magloire and in the first place
was that silver ours madame magloire was speechless another silence ensued then the bishop went on madame maglora i have for a long time detained that silver wrongfully it belonged to the poor who was that man a poor man evidently alas jesu returned madame
it is not for my sake nor for mademoiselle's it makes no difference to us but it is for the sake of monseigneur what is monseigneur to eat with now the bishop gazed at her with an air of amazement ah come are there no such things as pewter forks and spoons madame magloire shrugged her shoulders pewter has an odour
iron forks and spoons then madame magloire made an expressive grimace iron has a taste very well said the bishop wooden ones then a few moments later he was breakfasting at the very table at which jean valjean had sat on the previous evening as he ate his breakfast monseigneur welcome remarked gaily to his sister who said nothing and to madame magloire who was grumbling under her breath
that one really does not need either fork or spoon even of wood in order to dip a bit of bread in a cup of milk a pretty idea truly said madame magloire to herself as she went and came to take in a man like that and to lodge him close to oneself and how fortunate that he did nothing but steal ah mon dieu it makes one shudder to think of it
as the brother and sister were about to rise from the table there came a knock at the door come in said the bishop the door opened a singular and violent group made its appearance on the threshold three men were holding a fourth man by the collar the three men were gendarmes the other was jean valjean a brigadier of gendarmes who seemed to be in command of the group was standing near the door he entered and advanced to the bishop making a military salute
monseigneur said he at this word jean valjean who was dejected and seemed overwhelmed raised his head with an air of stupefaction monseigneur he murmured so he is not the cure silence said the gendarme is he monseigneur the bishop in the meantime monseigneur bienvenu had advanced as quickly as his great age permitted ah here you are
he exclaimed looking at jean valjean i am glad to see you but how is this i gave you the candlesticks too which are of silver like the rest and for which you can certainly get two hundred francs why did you not carry them away with your forks and spoons jean valjean opened his eyes wide and stared at the venerable bishop with an expression which no human tongue can render any account of
monseigneur said the brigadier of gendarmes so what this man said is true then we came across him he was walking like a man who was running away we stopped him to look into the matter he had this silver and he told you interposed the bishop with a smile that it had been given to him by a kind old fellow of a priest with whom he had passed the night i see how the matter stands
and you have brought him back here it is a mistake in that case replied the brigadier we can let him go certainly replied the bishop the gendarmes released jean valjean who recoiled is it true i am to be released he said in an almost inarticulate voice and as though he were talking in his sleep yes thou art released dost thou not understand said one of the gendarmes
my friend resumed the bishop before you go here are your candlesticks take them he stepped to the chimney-piece took the two silver candlesticks and brought them to jean valjean the two women looked on without uttering a word without a gesture without a look which could disconcert the bishop jean valjean was trembling in every limb he took the two candlesticks mechanically and with a bewildered air now said the bishop
go in peace by the way when you return my friend it is not necessary to pass through the garden you can always enter and depart through the street door it is never fastened with anything but a latch either by day or by night then turning to the gendarmes you may retire gentlemen the gendarmes retired jean valjean was like a man on the point of fainting
the bishop drew near to him and said in a low voice do not forget never forget that you have promised to use this money in becoming an honest man jean valjean who had no recollection of ever having promised anything remained speechless the bishop had emphasized the words when he uttered them he resumed with solemnity jean valjean my brother you no longer belong to evil but to good
it is your soul that i buy from you i withdraw it from black thoughts and the spirit of perdition and i give it to god jean valjean left the town as though he were fleeing from it he set out at a very hasty pace through the fields taking whatever roads and paths presented themselves to him without perceiving that he was incessantly retracing his steps he wandered thus the whole morning without having eaten anything and without feeling hungry
he was the prey of a throng of novel sensations he was conscious of a sort of rage he did not know against whom it was directed he could not have told whether he was touched or humiliated there came over him at moments a strange emotion which he resisted and to which he opposed the hardness acquired during the last twenty years of his life this state of mind fatigued him he perceived with dismay that the sort of frightful calm which the injustice of his misfortune had conferred upon him was giving way within him
he asked himself what would replace this at times he would have actually preferred to be in prison with the gendarmes and that things should not have happened in this way it would have agitated him less although the season was tolerably far advanced there were still a few late flowers in the hedgerows here and there whose odour as he passed through them in his march recalled to him memories of his childhood these memories were almost intolerable to him it was so long since they had recurred to him
unutterable thoughts assembled within him in this manner all day long as the sun declined to its setting casting long shadows athwart the soil from every pebble jean valjean sat down behind a bush upon a large ruddy plain which was absolutely deserted there was nothing on the horizon except the alps not even the spire of a distant village jean valjean might have been three leagues distant from dix a path which intersected the plain passed a few paces from the bush
in the middle of this meditation which would have contributed not a little to render his rags terrifying to any one who might have encountered him a joyous sound became audible he turned his head and saw a little savoyard about ten years of age coming up the path and singing his hurdy-gurdy on his hip and his marmot box on his back one of those gay and gentle children who go from land to land affording a view of their knees through the holes in their trousers without stopping his song
the lad halted in his march from time to time and played at knuckle-bones with some coins which he had in his hand his whole fortune probably among this money there was one forty sous piece the child halted beside the bush without perceiving jean valjean and tossed up his handful of sous which up to that time he had caught with a good deal of adroitness on the back of his hand this time the forty sous piece escaped him and went rolling toward the brushwood until it reached jean valjean jean valjean set his foot upon it
in the meantime the child had looked after his coin and had caught sight of him he showed no astonishment but walked straight up to the man the spot was absolutely solitary as far as the eye could see there was not a person on the plain or on the path the only sound was the tiny feeble cries of a flock of birds of passage which was traversing the heavens at an immense height the child was standing with his back to the sun which cast threads of gold in his hair
and empurpled with its blood-red gleam the savage face of jean valjean sir said the little savoyard with that childish confidence which is composed of ignorance and innocence my money what is your name said jean valjean little gervais sir go away said jean valjean sir resumed the child give me back my money jean valjean dropped his head and made no reply the child began again my money sir
jean valjean's eyes remained fixed on the earth my piece of money cried the child my white piece my silver it seemed as though jean valjean did not hear him the child grasped him by the collar of his blouse and shook him at the same time he made an effort to displace the big iron-shod shoe which rested on his treasure i want my piece of money my piece of forty sous the child wept jean valjean raised his head he still remained seated
his eyes were troubled he gazed at the child in a sort of amazement then he stretched out his hand towards his cudgel and cried in a terrible voice who's there i sir replied the child little gervais give me back my forty sous if you please take your foot away sir if you please then irritated though he was so small and becoming almost menacing come now will you take your foot away take your foot away or we'll see ah it is still you
said jean valjean and rising abruptly to his feet his foot still resting on the silver piece he added will you take yourself off the frightened child looked at him then began to tremble from head to foot and after a few moments of stupor he set out running at the top of his speed without daring to turn his neck or to utter a cry nevertheless lack of breath forced him to halt after a certain distance and jean valjean heard him sobbing in the midst of his own reverie
at the end of a few moments the child had disappeared the sun had set the shadows were descending around jean valjean he had eaten nothing all day it is probable that he was feverish he had remained standing and had not changed his attitude after the child's flight the breath heaved his chest at long and irregular intervals his gaze
fixed ten or twelve paces in front of him seemed to be scrutinising with profound attention the shape of an ancient fragment of blue earthenware which had fallen in the grass all at once he shivered he had just begun to feel the chill of evening he settled his cap more firmly on his brow sought mechanically to cross and button his blouse advanced a step and stopped to pick up his cudgel at that moment he caught sight of the forty sous piece which his foot had half ground into the earth and which was shining among the pebbles
it was as though he had received a galvanic shock what is this he muttered between his teeth he recoiled three paces then halted without being able to detach his gaze from the spot which his foot had trodden but an instant before as though the thing which lay glittering there in the gloom had been an open eye riveted upon him at the expiration of a few moments he darted convulsively towards the silver coin seized it and straightened himself up again and began to gaze afar off over the plain
at the same time casting his eyes towards all points of the horizon as he stood there erect and shivering like a terrified wild animal which is seeking refuge he saw nothing night was falling the plain was cold and vague great banks of violet haze were rising in the gleam of the twilight
little gervais little gervais he paused and waited there was no reply the landscape was gloomy and deserted he was encompassed by space there was nothing around him but an obscurity in which his gaze was lost and a silence which engulfed his voice an icy north wind was blowing and imparted to things around him a sort of lugubrious life the bushes shook their thin little arms with incredible fury
one would have said that they were threatening and pursuing some one he set out on his march again then he began to run and from time to time he halted and shouted into that solitude with a voice which was the most formidable and the most disconsolate that it was possible to hear little chervil little chervil assuredly if the child had heard him he would have been alarmed and would have taken good care not to show himself but the child was no doubt already far away
he encountered a priest on horseback he stepped up to him and said monsieur le cure have you seen a child pass no said the priest one named little gervais i have seen no one he drew two five-franc pieces from his money-bag and handed them to the priest monsieur le cure this is for your poor people monsieur le cure he was a little lad about ten years old was a marmot i think
and hurdy-gurdy one of those servileards you know jean valjean i have not seen him jean valjean little gervais there are no villages here can you tell me jean valjean if he is like what you say my friend he is a little stranger such persons pass through these parts we know nothing of them jean valjean seized two more coins of five francs each with violence and gave them to the priest jean valjean for your poor he said
then he added wildly monseigneur l'abbe have me arrested i am a thief the priest put spurs to his horse and fled in haste much alarmed jean valjean set out on a run in the direction which he had first taken in this way he traversed a tolerably long distance gazing calling shouting but he met no one two or three times he ran across the plain towards something which conveyed to him the effect of a human being reclining or crouching down
it turned out to be nothing but brushwood or rocks nearly on a level with the earth at length at a spot where three paths intersected each other he stopped the moon had risen he sent his gaze into the distance and shouted for the last time his shout died away in the mist without even awakening an echo he murmured yet once more
but in a feeble and almost inarticulate voice it was his last effort his legs gave way abruptly under him as though an invisible power had suddenly overwhelmed him with the weight of his evil conscience he fell exhausted on a large stone his fists clenched in his hair and his face on his knees and he cried i am a wretch then his heart burst and he began to cry it was the first time that he had wept in nineteen years when jean valjean left the bishop's house he was as we have seen
quite thrown out of everything that had been his thought hitherto he could not yield to the evidence of what was going on within him he hardened himself against the angelic action and the gentle words of the old man you have promised me to become an honest man i buy your soul i take it away from the spirit of perversity i give it to the good god this recurred to his mind unceasingly to this celestial kindness he opposed pride
which is the fortress of evil within us he was indistinctly conscious that the pardon of this priest was the greatest assault and the most formidable attack which had moved him yet that his obduracy was finally settled if he resisted this clemency that if he yielded he should be obliged to renounce that hatred with which the actions of other men had filled his soul through so many years and which pleased him that this time it was necessary to conquer or to be conquered and that a struggle a colossal and final struggle
had been begun between his viciousness and the goodness of that man in the presence of these lights he proceeded like a man who is intoxicated as he walked thus with haggard eyes did he have a distinct perception of what might result to him from his adventure at d did he understand all those mysterious murmurs which warn or importune the spirit at certain moments of life did a voice whisper in his ear that he had just passed the solemn hour of his destiny that there no longer remained a middle course for him
that if he were not henceforth the best of men he would be the worst that it behoved him now so to speak to mount higher than the bishop or fall lower than the convict that if he wished to become good he must become an angel that if he wished to remain evil he must become a monster here again some questions must be put which we have already put to ourselves elsewhere did he catch some shadow of all this in his thought in a confused way
misfortune certainly as we have said does form the education of the intelligence nevertheless it is doubtful whether jean valjean was in a condition to disentangle all that we have here indicated if these ideas occurred to him he but caught glimpses of rather than saw them and they only succeeded in throwing him into an unutterable and almost painful state of emotion on emerging from that black and deformed thing which is called the galleys the bishop had hurt his soul
as too vivid a light would have hurt his eyes on emerging from the dark the future life the possible life which offered itself to him henceforth all pure and radiant filled him with tremors and anxiety he no longer knew where he really was like an owl who should suddenly see the sun rise the convict had been dazzled and blinded as it were by virtue that which was certain that which he did not doubt was that he was no longer the same man that everything about him was changed
that it was no longer in his power to make it as though the bishop had not spoken to him and had not touched him in this state of mind he had encountered little gervais and had robbed him of his forty sous why he certainly could not have explained it was this the last effect and the supreme effort as it were of the evil thoughts which he had brought away from the galleys a remnant of impulse a result of what is called in statics acquired force it was that and it was also perhaps even less than that
let us say it simply it was not he who stole it was not the man it was the beast who by habit and instinct had simply placed his foot upon that money while the intelligence was struggling amid so many novel and hitherto unheard-of thoughts besetting it when intelligence reawakened and beheld that action of the brute jean valjean recoiled with anguish and uttered a cry of terror it was because strange phenomenon and one which was possible only in the situation in which he found himself
in stealing the money from that child he had done a thing of which he was no longer capable however that may be this last evil action had a decisive effect on him it abruptly traversed that chaos which he bore in his mind and dispersed it placed on one side the thick obscurity and on the other the light and acted on his soul in the state in which it then was as certain chemical reagents act upon a troubled mixture by precipitating one element and clarifying the other
first of all even before examining himself and reflecting all bewildered like one who seeks to save himself he tried to find the child in order to return his money to him then when he recognised the fact that this was impossible he halted in despair at the moment when he exclaimed i am a wretch he had just perceived what he was and he was already separated from himself to such a degree that he seemed to himself to be no longer anything more than a phantom
and as if he had there before him in flesh and blood the hideous galley convict jean valjean cudgel in hand his blouse on his hips his knapsack filled with stolen objects on his back with his resolute and gloomy visage with his thoughts filled with abominable projects excess of unhappiness had as we have remarked made him in some sort a visionary this then was in the nature of a vision he actually saw that jean valjean that sinister face before him
he had almost reached the point of asking himself who that man was and he was horrified by him his brain was going through one of those violent and yet perfectly calm moments in which reverie is so profound that it absorbs reality one no longer beholds the object which one has before one and one sees as though apart from one's self the figures which one has in one's own mind thus he contemplated himself so to speak face to face and at the same time athwart this hallucination
he perceived in a mysterious depth a sort of light which he at first took for a torch on scrutinising this light which appeared to his conscience with more attention he recognised the fact that it possessed a human form and that this torch was the bishop his conscience weighed in turn these two men thus placed before it the bishop and jean valjean nothing less than the first was required to soften the second by one of those singular effects which are peculiar to this sort of ecstasies
in proportion as his reverie continued as the bishop grew great and resplendent in his eyes so did jean valjean grow less and vanish after a certain time he was no longer anything more than a shade all at once he disappeared the bishop alone remained he filled the whole soul of this wretched man with a magnificent radiance jean valjean wept for a long time he wept burning tears he sobbed with more weakness than a woman with more fright than a child
as he wept daylight penetrated more and more clearly into his soul an extraordinary light a light at once ravishing and terrible his past life his first fault his long expiation his external brutishness his internal hardness his dismissal to liberty rejoicing in manifold plans of vengeance what had happened to him at the bishop's the last thing that he had done that theft of forty sous from a child
a crime all the more cowardly and all the more monstrous since it had come after the bishop's pardon all this recurred to his mind and appeared clearly to him but with a clearness which he had never hitherto witnessed he examined his life and it seemed horrible to him his soul and it seemed frightful to him in the meantime a gentle light rested over this life and this soul it seemed to him that he beheld satan by the light of paradise how many hours did he weep thus
what did he do after he had wept whither did he go no one ever knew the only thing which seems to be authenticated is that that same night the carrier who served grenoble at that epoch and who arrived at d about three o'clock in the morning saw as he traversed the street in which the bishop's residence was situated a man in the attitude of prayer kneeling on the pavement in the shadow in front of the door of monseigneur welcome chapter twelve and thirteen of les miserables by victor hugo

the kiss it was still quite light out of doors but inside with the curtains drawn and the smouldering fire sending out a dim uncertain glow the room was full of deep shadows brantain sat in one of these shadows it had overtaken him
and he did not mind the obscurity lent him courage to keep his eyes fastened as ardently as he liked upon the girl who had sat in the firelight she was very handsome with a certain fine rich colouring that belongs to the healthy brunette type she was quite composed as she idly stroked the satiny coat of the cat that lay curled in her lap
and she occasionally sent a slow glance into the shadow where her companion sat they were talking lo of indifferent things which plainly were not the things that occupied their thoughts she knew that he loved her a frank blustering fellow without guile enough to conceal his feelings and no desire to do so
for two weeks past he had sought her society eagerly and persistently she was confidently waiting for him to declare himself and she meant to accept him the rather insignificant and unattractive bront was enormously rich and she liked and required the entourage which wealth could give her during one of the pauses between their talk of the last tea and the next reception
the door opened and a young man entered whom brantaine knew quite well the girl turned her face toward him a stride or two brought him to her side and bending over her chair before she could suspect his intention for she did not realize that he had not seen her visitor he pressed an ardent lingering kiss upon her lips brantaine slowly arose so did the girl arise
but quickly and the newcomer stood between them a little amusement and some defiance struggling with the confusion in his face i believe stammered i see that i have stayed too long i-i had no idea that-that is i must wish you good-bye
he was clutching his hat with both hands and probably did not perceive that she was extending her hand to him her presence of mind had not completely deserted her but she could not have trusted herself to speak hang me if i saw him sitting there natty i know it's deuced awkward for you but i hope you'll forgive me this once this very first break why what's the matter
don't touch me don't come near me she returned angrily what do you mean by entering the house without ringing i came in with your brother as i often do he answered coldly in self-justification we came in the side way he went upstairs and i came in here hoping to find you the explanation is simple enough and ought to satisfy you that the
misadventure was unavoidable but do say that you forgive me natalie he entreated softening forgive you you don't know what you are talking about let me pass it depends upon a good deal whether i ever forgive you at that next reception which she and brontane had been talking about she approached the young man with a delicious frankness of manner when she saw him there
will you let me speak to you a moment or two mr brantane she asked with an engaging but perturbed smile he seemed extremely unhappy but when she took his arm and walked away with him seeking a retired corner a ray of hope mingled with the almost comical misery of his expression she was apparently very outspoken perhaps i should not have sought this interview mr brantane
but oh i have been very uncomfortable almost miserable since that little encounter the other afternoon when i thought how you might have misinterpreted it and believed things hope was plainly gaining the ascendancy over misery in brontane's round guileless face of course i know it is nothing to you but for my own sake i do want you to understand that mr harvey is an intimate friend of long standing
why we have always been like cousins like brother and sister i may say he is my brother's most intimate associate and often fancies that he is entitled to the same privileges as the family oh i know it is absurd uncalled for to tell you this undignified even she was almost weeping but it makes so much difference to me what you think of-of me
her voice had grown very low and agitated the misery had all disappeared from brantain's face then you really do care what i think miss natalie may i call you miss natalie they turned into a long dim corridor that was lined on either side with tall graceful plants they walked slowly to the very end of it when they turned to retrace their steps
brantain's face was radiant and hers was triumphant harvey was among the guests at the wedding and he sought her out in a rare moment when she stood alone your husband he said smiling has sent me over to kiss you a quick blush suffused her face and round polished throat
i suppose it's natural for a man to feel and act generously on an occasion of this kind he tells me he doesn't want his marriage to interrupt wholly that pleasant intimacy which has existed between you and me i don't know what you've been telling him with an insolent smile but he has sent me here to kiss you she felt like a chess-player
who by the clever handling of his pieces sees the game taking the course intended her eyes were bright and tender with a smile as they glanced upon his and her lips looked hungry for the kiss which they invited but you know he went on quietly i didn't tell him so it would have seemed ungrateful but i can tell you
i've stopped kissing women it's dangerous well she had brantane and his million left a person can't have everything in this world and it was a little unreasonable of her to expect it end of the kiss from the awakening and selected short stories by kate
THE INNOCENCE OF FATHER BROWN CHAPTER X BY G. K. CHESTERTON THE EYE OF APOLLO FATHER BROWN
read by wayne cook flambeau read by wayne cook kalon the prophet read by greg giordano miss jane stacey read by trice lindhall miss pauline stacey read by lynette calkins narrated by mozart jr that singular smoky sparkle at once a confusion and a transparency
which is the strange secret of the thames was changing more and more from its grey to its glittering extreme as the sun climbed to the zenith over westminster and two men crossed westminster bridge one man was very tall and the other very short they might even have been fantastically compared to the arrogant clock tower of parliament and the humbler humped shoulders of the abbey for the short man was in clerical dress
the official description of the tall man was m hercule flambeau private detective and he was going to his new offices in a new pile of flats facing the abbey entrance the official description of the short man was the rev j brown attached to st francis xavier's church camberwell and he was going from a camberwell death-bed to see the new offices of his friend
the building was american in its sky-scraping altitude and american also in the oiled elaboration of its machinery of telephones and lifts but it was barely finished and still understaffed only three tenants had moved in the office just above flambeau was occupied as also was the office just below him the two floors above that and the three floors below were entirely bare but the first glance at the new tower of flats caught something much more arresting
save for a few relics of scaffolding the one glaring object was erected outside the office just above flambeau's it was an enormous gilt effigy of the human eye surrounded with rays of gold and taking up as much room as two or three of the office windows what on earth is that asked father brown and stood still i do religion said flambeau laughing
one of those no religions that forgive your sins by saying you never had any rather like christian science i should think the fact is that a fellow calling himself calon i don't know what his name is except it can't be that has taken the flat just above me i have two lady typewriters underneath me and this enthusiastic old humbug on top he calls himself the new priest of apollo
and he worships the sun let him look out said father brown the sun was the cruellest of all the gods but what does that monstrous eye mean as i understand it it is a story of theirs answered flambeau that a man can endure anything if his mind is quite steady there are two great symbols the sun and the open
for they say if a man were really healthy he could stare at the sun if a man were really healthy said father brown he would not bother to stare at it well that's all i can tell you about in religion went on flambeau carelessly it claims of course that it can cure all physical diseases can it cure the one spiritual disease asked father brown with a serious curiosity
and what is there one spiritual disease asked flambeau smiling oh thinking one is quite well said his friend flambeau was much more interested in the quiet little office below him than in the flamboyant temple above he was a lucid southerner incapable of conceiving himself as anything but a catholic or an atheist and new religions of a bright and pallid sort were not much in his line
but humanity was always in his line especially when it was good-looking moreover the ladies downstairs were characters in their way the office was kept by two sisters both slight and dark one of them tall and striking she had a dark eager and aquiline profile and was one of those women whom one always thinks of in profile as of the clean-cut edge of some weapon she seemed to cleave her way through life
she had eyes of startling brilliancy but it was the brilliancy of steel rather than of diamonds and her straight slim figure was a shade too stiff for its grace her younger sister was like her short and shadow a little greyer paler and more insignificant they both wore business-like black with little masculine cuffs and collars there are thousands of such curt strenuous ladies in the offices of london but the interest of these lay rather in their real than their apparent position
for pauline stacey the elder was actually the heiress of a crest and half a county as well as great wealth she had been brought up in castles and gardens before a frigid fierceness peculiar to the modern woman had driven her to what she considered a harsher and a higher existence she had not indeed surrendered her money in that there would have been a romantic or monkish abandon quite alien to her masterful utilitarianism she held her wealth she would say for use upon practical social objects
part of it she had put into her business the nucleus of a model typewriting emporium part of it was distributed in various leagues and cases for the advancement of such work among women how far joan her sister and partner shared this slightly prosaic idealism no one could be sure but she followed her leader with a dog-like affection which was somehow more attractive with its touch of tragedy than the hard high spirits of the elder for pauline stacey had nothing to say to tragedy
she was understood to deny its existence her rigid rapidity and cold impatience had amused flambeau very much on the first occasion of his entering the flats he had lingered outside the lift in the entrance hall waiting for the lift boy who generally conducts strangers to the various floors but this bright-eyed falcon of a girl had openly refused to endure such official delay she said sharply that she knew all about the lift and was not dependent on boys or men either though her flat was only three floors above
she managed in the few seconds of assent to give flambeau a great many of her fundamental views in an off-hand manner they were to the general effect that she was a modern working woman and loved modern working machinery her bright black eyes blazed with abstract anger against those who rebuke mechanic science and ask for the return of romance every one she said ought to be able to manage machines just as she could manage the lift
she seemed almost to resent the fact of flambeau opening the lift door for her and that gentleman went up to his own apartments smiling with somewhat mingled feelings at the memory of such spitfire self-dependence she certainly had a temper of a snappy practical sort the gestures of her thin elegant hands were abrupt or even destructive once flambeau entered her office on some typewriting business and found she had just flung a pair of spectacles belonging to her sister into the middle of the floor and stamped on them
she was already in the rapids of an ethical tirade against the sickly medical notions and the morbid admission of weakness implied in such an apparatus she dared her sister to bring such artificial unhealthy rubbish into the place again she asked if she was expected to wear wooden legs or false hair or glass eyes and as she spoke her eyes sparkled like the terrible crystal
flambeau quite bewildered with this fanaticism could not refrain from asking miss pauline with direct french logic why a pair of spectacles was a more morbid sign of weakness than a lift and why if science might help us in the one effort it might not help us in the other that is so different said pauline stacey loftily batteries and motors and all those things are marks of the force of man yes mr flambeau and the force of woman too
we shall take our turn at these great engines that devour distance and defy time that is high and splendid that is really science but these nasty props and plasters the doctors sell why they are just badges of poltroonery doctors stick on legs and arms as if we were born cripples and sick slaves but i was free-born mr
people only think they need these things because they have been trained in fear instead of being trained in power and courage just as the silly nurses tell children not to stare at the sun and so they can't do it without blinking but why among the stars should there be one star i may not see the sun is not my master and i will open my eyes and stare at him whenever i choose
your eyes said flambeau with a foreign bow will dazzle the sun he took pleasure in complimenting this strange stiff beauty partly because it threw her a little off her balance but as he went upstairs to his floor he drew a deep breath and whistled saying to himself so she has got into the hands of that conger upstairs with his golden eye
for little as he knew or cared about the new religion of kalon he had heard of his special notion about sun-gazing he soon discovered that the spiritual bond between the floors above and below him was close and increasing the man who called himself kalon was a magnificent creature worthy in a physical sense to be the pontiff of apollo
he was nearly as tall even as flambeau and very much better looking with a golden beard strong blue eyes and a mane flung back like a lion's in structure he was the blond beast of nietzsche but all this animal beauty was heightened brightened and softened by genuine intellect and spirituality if he looked like one of the great saxon kings he looked like one of the kings that were also saints and this despite the cockney incongruity of his surroundings
the fact that he had had an office half-way up a building in victoria street that the clerk a commonplace youth in cuffs and collars sat in the outer room between him and the corridor that his name was on a brass plate and this gilt emblem of his creed hung above his street like the advertisement of an oculist all this vulgarity could not take away from the man called calon with the vivid oppression and inspiration that came from his soul and body
when always said a man in the presence of this quack did feel in the presence of a great man even in the loose jacket suit of linen that he wore as a workshop dress in his office he was a fascinating and formidable figure and when robed in the white vestments and crowned with the golden circlet in which he daily saluted the sun he really looked so splendid that the laughter of the street people sometimes died suddenly on their lips
for three times in the day the new sun-worshipper went out on his little balcony in the face of all westminster to say some litany to his shining lord once at daybreak once at sunset and once at the shock of noon and it was while the shock of noon still shook faintly from the towers of parliament and parish church that father brown the friend of flambeau first looked up and saw the white priest of apollo
flambeau had seen quite enough of these daily salutations of phoebus and plunged into the porch of the tall building without even looking for his clerical friend to follow but father brown whether from a professional interest in ritual or a strong individual interest in tomfoolery stopped and stared up at the balcony of the sun worshipper just as he might have stopped and stared up at a punch and judy calon the prophet was already erect
with argent garments and uplifted hands and the sound of his strangely penetrating voice could be heard all the way down the busy street uttering his solar litany he was already in the middle of it his eyes were fixed upon a flaming disk it is doubtful if he saw anything or anyone on this earth it is substantially certain that he did not see a stunted round-faced priest who in the crowd below looked up at him with blinking eyes that was perhaps the most startling difference between even these two far-divided men
father brown could not look at anything without blinking but the priest of apollo could look on the blaze at noon without a quiver of the eyelid o sun cried the prophet o star that art too great to be allowed among the stars o fountain that floweth quietly in that secret spot that is called space white father of all white unwearied things
white flames and white flowers and white peaks father who art more innocent than all thy most innocent and quiet children primal purity into the peace of which a rush and crash like the reversed rush of a rocket was cloven with a strident and incessant yelling
Five people rushed into the gate of the mansions, as three people rushed out, and for an instant they all deafened each other. The sense of some utterly abrupt horror seemed for a moment to fill half the street with bad news. Bad news that was all the worse because no one knew what it was. Two figures remained still after the crash of commotion. The fair priest of Apollo on the balcony above, and the ugly priest of Christ below him.
at last the tall figure and titanic energy of flambeau appeared in the doorway of the mansions and dominated the little mob talking at the top of his voice like a fog-horn he told somebody or anybody to go for a surgeon and as he turned back into the dark and thronged entrance his friend father brown dipped in insignificantly after him
even as he ducked and dived through the crowd he could still hear the magnificent melody and monotony of the solar priest still calling on the happy god who is the friend of fountains and flowers father brown found flambeau and some six other people standing round the enclosed space into which the lift commonly descended but the lift had not descended something else had descended something that ought to have come by a lift for the last four minutes flambeau had looked down on it
had seen the brained and bleeding figure of that beautiful woman who denied the existence of tragedy he had never had the slightest doubt that it was pauline stacey and though he had sent for a doctor he had not the slightest doubt that she was dead he could not remember for certain whether he had liked her or disliked her there was so much both to like and dislike but she had been a person to him
and the unbearable pathos of details and habits stabbed him with all the small daggers of bereavement he remembered her pretty face and priggish speeches with a sudden secret vividness which is all the bitterness of death in an instant like a bolt from the blue like a thunderbolt from nowhere that beautiful and defiant body had been dashed down the open well of the lift to death at the bottom was it suicide with so insolent an optimist it seemed impossible was it murder
but who was there in those hardly inhabited flats to murder anybody in a rush of raucous words which he meant to be strong and suddenly found weak he asked where was that fellow a voice habitually heavy quiet and full assured him that kalon for the last fifteen minutes had been away up on his balcony worshipping his god when flambeau heard the voice and felt the hand of father brown he turned his swarthy face and said abruptly
then if he has been up there all the time who could have done it perhaps said the other we might go upstairs and find out we have half an hour before the police will move leaving the body of the slain heiress in charge of the surgeons flambeau dashed up the stairs to the typewriting office found it utterly empty and then dashed up to his own having entered that he abruptly returned with a new and white face to his friend
sister he said with an unpleasant seriousness sister seems to have gone out for a walk father brown nodded or she may have gone up to the office of that sun man he said if i were you i should just verify that and let us talk it over in your office no he added suddenly as if remembering something shall i ever get over that stupidity of mine of course
in their office downstairs flambeau stared but he followed the little father downstairs to the empty flat of the stacy's where that impenetrable pastor took a large red leather chair in the very entrance from which he could see the stairs and landings and waited he did not wait very long in about four minutes three figures descended the stairs alike only in their solemnity the first was joan stacy the sister of the dead woman
evidently she had been upstairs in the temporary temple of apollo the second was the priest of apollo himself his litany finished sweeping down the empty stairs in utter magnificence something in his white robes beard and parted hair had the look of dore's christ leaving the praetorium the third was flambeau black-browed and somewhat bewildered
miss joan stacey dark with a drawn face and hair prematurely touched with gray walked straight to her own desk and set out her papers with a practical flap the mere action rallied every one else to sanity if miss joan stacey was a criminal she was a cool one father brown regarded her for some time with an odd little smile and then without taking his eyes off her addressed himself to somebody else prophet he said presumably addressing kalon i wish you would tell me a lot about your religion
i shall be proud to do it said kalon inclining his still crowned head but i am not sure that i understand why it's like this said father brown in his frankly doubtful way we're taught that if a man has really bad first principles that must be partly his fault but for all that
we can make some difference between a man who insults his quite clear conscience and a man with a conscience more or less clouded with sophistries now do you really think that murder is wrong at all is this an accusation asked kalon very quietly no answered brown equally gently it is a speech for the defence
in the long and startled stillness of the room the prophet of apollo slowly rose and really it was like the rising of the sun he filled that room with his light and life in such a manner that a man felt he could as easily have filled salisbury plain his robed form seemed to hang the whole room with classic draperies his epic gesture seemed to extend it into grander perspectives till the little black figure of the modern cleric
seemed to be a fault and an intrusion a round black dot upon some splendor of halos we meet at last caiaphas said the prophet your church and mine are the only realities on this earth i adore the sun and you the darkening of the sun you are the priest of the dying and i of the living god
your present work of suspicion and slander is worthy of your coat and creed all your church is but a black police you are only spies and detectives seeking to tear from men confessions of guilt whether by treachery or torture you would convict men of crime
of innocence you would convince them of sin i would convince them of virtue reader of the books of evil one more word before i blow away your baseless nightmares forever not even faintly could you understand how little i care whether you can convict me or no
the things you call disgrace and horrible hanging are to me no more than an ogre in a child's toy book to a man once grown up you said you were offering the speech for the defence i care so little for the cloudland of this life that i will offer you the speech for the prosecution
there is but one thing that can be said against me in this matter and i will say it myself the woman that is dead was my love and my bride not after such manner as your tin chapels call lawful but by a law purer and sterner than you will ever understand
she and i walked another world from yours and trod palaces of crystal while you were plodding through tunnels and corridors of brick well i know that policemen theological and otherwise always fancy that where there has been love there must soon be hatred so there you have
the first point made for the prosecution but the second point is stronger i do not grudge it you not only is it true that pauline loved me but it is also true that this very morning before she died she wrote at that table a will leaving me and my new church half a million
come where are the handcuffs do you suppose i care what foolish things you do with me penal servitude will only be like waiting for her at a wayside station the gallows will only be going to her in a headlong car he spoke with the brain-shaking authority of an orator and flambeau and joan stacey stared at him in amazed admiration
father brown's face seemed to express nothing but extreme distress he looked at the ground with one wrinkle of pain across his forehead the prophet of the sun leaned easily against the mantelpiece and resumed in a few words i have put before you the whole case against me the only possible case against me in fewer words still i will blow it to pieces so that not a trace of it remains
as to whether i have committed this crime the truth is in one sentence i could not have committed this crime pauline stacey fell from this floor to the ground at five minutes past twelve a hundred people will go into the witness-box and say that i was standing out upon the balcony of my own rooms above from just before
the stroke of noon to a quarter past the usual period of my public prayers my clerk a respectable youth from clapham with no sort of connection with me will swear that he sat in my outer office all the morning and that no communication passed through he will swear that i arrived a full ten minutes before the hour
fifteen minutes before any whisper of the accident and that i did not leave the office or the balcony all that time no one ever had so complete an alibi i could subpena half westminster i think you had better put the handcuffs away again the case is at an end but last of all that no breath of this idiotic suspicion remain in the air
i will tell you all you want to know i believe i do know how my unhappy friend came by her death you can if you choose blame me for it or my faith and philosophy at least but you certainly cannot lock me up it is well known to all students of the higher truths that certain adepts and illuminati have in history attained the power
of levitation that is of being self-sustained upon the empty air it is but a part of that general conquest of matter which is the main element in our occult wisdom poor pauline was of an impulsive and ambitious temper i think to tell the truth
she thought herself somewhat deeper in the mysteries than she was and she has often said to me as we went down in the lift together that if one's will were strong enough one could float down as harmlessly as a feather i solemnly believe that in some ecstasy of noble thoughts she attempted the miracle her will or faith
must have failed her at the crucial instant and the lower law of matter had its horrible revenge there is the whole story gentlemen very sad and as you think very presumptuous and wicked but certainly not criminal or in any way connected with me in the shorthand of the police courts you had better call it suicide
i shall always call it heroic failure for the advance of science and the slow scaling of heaven it was the first time flambeau had ever seen father brown vanquished he still sat looking at the ground with a painful and corrugated brow as if in shame
it was impossible to avoid the feeling which the prophet's winged words had found that here was a sullen professional suspector of men overwhelmed by a prouder and purer spirit of natural liberty and health at last he said blinking as if in bodily distress well if that is so sir you need do no more than take the testamentary paper you spoke of and go i wonder where the poor lady left it
it will be over there on her desk by the door i think said kalon with that massive innocence of manner that seemed to acquit him wholly she told me specially she would write it this morning and i actually saw her writing as i went up in the lift to my own room was her door open then asked the priest with his eye on the corner of the matting yes said kalon calmly ah
it has been open ever since said the other and resumed his silent study of the mat there is a paper over here said the grim miss joan in a somewhat singular voice she had passed over to her sister's desk by the doorway and was holding a sheet of blue foolscap in her hand there was a sour smile on her face that seemed unfit for such a scene or occasion and flambeau looked at her with a darkening brow
calon the prophet stood away from the paper with that loyal unconsciousness that had carried him through but flambeau took it out of the lady's hand and read it with the utmost amazement it did indeed begin in the formal manner of a will but after the words i give and bequeath all of which i die possessed the writing abruptly stopped with a set of scratches and there was no trace of the name of any legatee flambeau in a wonder handed this truncated testament to his clerical friend
who glanced at it and silently gave it to the priest of the sun an instant afterwards that pontiff in his splendid sweeping draperies had crossed the room in two great strides and was towering over joan stacey his blue eyes standing from his head what monkey tricks have you been playing here he cried that's not all pauline wrote
they were startled to hear him speak in quite a new voice with a yankee shrillness in it all his grandeur and good english had fallen from him like a cloak that is the only thing on her desk said joan and confronted him steadily with the same smile of evil favor of a sudden the man broke out into blasphemies and cataracts of incredulous words there was something shocking about the dropping of his mask it was like a man's real face falling off see here
he cried in broad american when he was breathless with cursing i may be an adventurer but i guess you're a murderess yes gentlemen here's your death explained and without any levitation the poor girl is writing a will in my favor her cursed sister comes in struggles for the pen drags her to the well and throws her down before she can finish it
sakes i reckon we want the handcuffs after all as you have truly remarked replied joan with ugly calm your clerk is a very respectable young man who knows the nature of an oath and he will swear in any court that i was up in your office arranging some typewriting work for five minutes before and five minutes after my sister fell mr flambeau will tell you that he found me there there was a silence
why then cried flambeau valinde was alone when she fell it was a suicide she was alone when she fell said father brown but it was not suicide then how did she die asked flambeau impatiently she was murdered but she was alone objected the detective she was murdered when she was all alone
answered the priest all the rest stared at him but he remained sitting in the same old dejected attitude with a wrinkle in his round forehead and an appearance of impersonal shame and sorrow his voice was colorless and sad what i want to know cried kalon with an oath is when the police are coming for this bloody and wicked sister she's killed her flesh and blood she's robbed me
of half a million that was just as sacredly mine as come come prophet interrupted flambeau with a kind of sneer remember that all this world is a cloudland the hierophant of the sun god made an effort to climb back on his pedestal it is not the mere money he cried though that would equip the cause throughout the world it is also my beloved one's wishes to pauline
all this was holy in pauline's eyes father brown suddenly sprang erect so that his chair fell over flat behind him he was deathly pale yet he seemed fired with a new hope his eyes shone that's it he cried in a clear voice that's the way to begin in pauline's eyes the tall prophet retreated before the tiny priest in almost mad disorder what do you mean
dare you he cried repeatedly in pauline's eyes repeated the priest his own shining more and more go on go on the foulest rhyme the fiends ever prompted feels lighter after confession and i implore you to confess go on go on in pauline's eyes let me go you devil thundered kalon struggling like a giant in bonds
who are you you cursed spy to weave your spider's webs round me and peep and peer let me go shall i stop him asked flambeau bounding towards the exit for kalon had already thrown the door wide open no let him pass said father brown with a strange deep sigh that seemed to come from the depths of the universe let cain pass by
for he belongs to god there was a long-drawn silence in the room when he had left it which was to flambeau's fierce wits one long agony of interrogation miss joan stacey very coolly tidied up the papers on her desk said flambeau at last it is my duty and not my curiosity only it is my duty to find out if i can who committed the crime which crime asked father brown
the one we are dealing with of course replied his impatient friend we are dealing with two crimes said brown crimes of very different weight and by very different criminals miss jones stacey having collected and put away her papers proceeded to lock up her drawer father brown went on noticing her as little as she noticed him the two crimes he observed
were committed against the same weaknesses of the same person and they struggled for her money the author of the larger crime found himself thwarted by the smaller crime the author of the smaller crime got the money groaned flambeau put it in a few words i can put it in one word answered his friend
miss joan stacey skewered her business-like black hat on to her head with a business-like black frown before a little mirror and as the conversation proceeded took her handbag and umbrella in an unhurried style and left the room the truth is one word and a short one said father brown pauline stacey was blind blind repeated flambeau and rose slowly to his whole huge stature
she was subject to it by blood brown proceeded her sister would have started eyeglasses if pauline would have let her but it was her special philosophy or fad that one must not encourage such diseases by yielding to them she would not admit the cloud or she tried to dispel it by will so her eyes got worse and worse with straining but the worst strain was to come
it came with this precious prophet or whatever he calls himself who taught her to stare at the hot sun with the naked eye it was called accepting apollo oh if these new pagans would only be old pagans they would be a little wiser the old pagans knew that mere naked nature-worship must have a cruel side they knew that the eye of apollo
can blast and blind there was a pause and the priest went on in a gentle and even broken voice whether or no that devil deliberately made her blind there is no doubt that he deliberately killed her through her blindness the very simplicity of the crime is sickening you know he and she went up and down in those lifts with artificial help
you know also how smoothly and silently the lifts slide calon brought the lift to the girl's landing and saw her through the open door writing in a slow sightless way the will she had promised him he called out to her cheerily that he had left the lift ready for her and she was to come out when she was ready then he pressed a button and shot soundlessly up to his own floor
walked through his own office out onto his own balcony and was safely praying before the crowded street when the poor girl having finished her work ran gaily out to where her lover and lift were to receive her and stepped don't cried flambeau he ought to have got a half million by pressing that button continued the little father in the colourless voice in which he talked of such horrors
but that went smash it went smash because there happened to be another person who also wanted the money and who also knew the secret about paul pauline's sight there was one thing about that will that i think nobody noticed although it was unfinished and without signature the other miss stacey and some servant of hers had already signed it as witnesses joan had signed first
saying pauline could finish it later with a typical feminine contempt for legal forms therefore joan wanted her sister to sign the will without real witnesses why i thought of the blindness and felt sure that she had wanted pauline to sign in solitude because she had wanted her not to sign at all people like the stacys always use fountain pens
but this was specially natural to pauline by habit and her strong will and memory she could still write almost as well as if she saw but she could not tell when her pen needed dipping therefore her fountain pens were carefully filled by her sister all except this fountain pen this was carefully not filled by her sister the remains of the ink held out for a few lines
and then failed altogether and the prophet lost five hundred thousand pounds and committed one of the most brutal and brilliant murders in human history for nothing flambeau went to the open door and heard the official police ascending the stairs he turned and said you must have followed everything devilishly close to have traced the crime to ceylon in ten minutes father brown gave a sort of start
to him he said no i had to follow rather closely to find out about miss joan and the fountain pen but i knew calon was the criminal before i came into the front door you must be joking cried flambeau i'm quite serious answered the priest i tell you i knew he had done it even before i knew what he had done but why
these pagan stoics said brown reflectively always fail by their strength there came a crash and a scream down the street and the priest of apollo did not start or look round i did not know what it was but i knew that he was expecting it and of the eye of apollo

read by wayne cook mrs allen read by wendy katzhiller dr blair read by greg giordano section eight the quarantine at alexander abraham's i refused to take that class in sunday school the first time i was asked it was not that i objected to teaching in the sunday school on the contrary i rather liked the idea but it was the rev mr allen who asked me and it had always been a matter of principle with me never to do anything a man asked me to do if i could help it i was noted for that
it saves a great deal of trouble and it simplifies everything beautifully i had always disliked men it must have been born in me because as far back as i can remember an antipathy to men and dogs was one of my strongest characteristics i was noted for that my experiences through life only served to deepen it the more i saw of men the more i liked cats so of course when the rev allan asked me if i would consent to take a class in sunday school i said no in a fashion calculated to chasten him wholesomely if he had sent his wife the first time as he did the second it would have been wiser
People generally do what Mrs. Allen asks them to do because they know it saves time. Mrs. Allen talked smoothly for half an hour before she mentioned the Sunday school and paid me several compliments. Mrs. Allen is famous for her tact. Tact is a faculty for meandering around to a given point instead of making a beeline. I have no tact. I am noted for that. As soon as Mrs. Allen's conversation came in sight of the Sunday school, I, who knew all along whether it was tending, said straight out, What class do you want me to teach? Mrs. Allen was so surprised that she forgot to be tactful and answered plainly for once in her life.
there are two classes one of boys and one of girls needing a teacher i have been teaching the girls class but i shall have to give it up for a little time on account of the baby's health you may have your choice miss mcpherson
then i shall take the boys i said decidedly i am noted for my decision since they have to grow up to be men it's well to train them properly betimes nuisances they are bound to become under any circumstances but if they are taken in hand young enough they may not grow up to be such nuisances as they otherwise would and that will be some unfortunate woman's gain mrs allen looked dubious i knew she had expected me to choose the girls they are a very wild set of boys she said i never knew boys who weren't i retorted i-i think perhaps
you would like the girls best said mrs allen hesitatingly if it had not been for one thing which i would never in this world have admitted to mrs allen i might have liked the girls class best myself but the truth was anne shirley was in that class and anne shirley was the one living human being that i was afraid of not that i disliked her but she had such a habit of asking weird unexpected questions which a philadelphia lawyer couldn't answer miss rogerson had that class once and anne routed her horse-foot and artillery
i wasn't going to undertake a class with a walking interrogation point in it like that besides i thought mrs allan required a slight snub miss mr's wives are rather apt to think they can run everything and everybody if they are not wholesomely corrected now and again it is not what i like best that must be considered mrs allan i said rebukingly it is what is best for those boys i feel that i shall be best for them oh i've no doubt of that miss mcpherson said mrs allan amiably
It was a fib for her minister's wife, though she was. She had doubt. She thought I would be a dismal failure as a teacher of a boys' class. But I was not. I am not often a dismal failure when I make up my mind to do a thing. I am noted for that.' "'It is wonderful what a reformation you have worked in that class, Miss McPherson. Wonderful,' said the Reverend Mr. Allen some weeks later. He didn't mean to show how amazing a thing he thought, it that an old maid noted for being a man-hater should have managed it, but his face betrayed him.
where does jimmy spencer live i asked him crisply he came one sunday three weeks ago and hasn't been back since i mean to find out why mr allan coughed i believe he is hired as handy boys with alexander abraham bennett out on the white sands road he said then i am going out to alexander abraham bennett's on the white sands road to see why jimmy spencer doesn't come to sunday school i said firmly mr allan's eyes twinkled ever so slightly
i have always insisted that if that man had not been a minister he would have a sense of humor possibly mr bennett will not appreciate your kind interest he has a-a singular aversion to your sex i understand no woman has ever been known to get inside of mr bennett's house since his sister died twenty years ago
oh he is the one is he i said remembering he is the woman-hater who threatens that if a woman comes into his yard he'll chase her out with a pitchfork well he will not chase me out mr allan gave a chuckle a ministerial chuckle but still a chuckle it irritated me slightly because it seemed to imply that he thought alexander abraham bennett would be one too many for me but i did not show mr allan that he annoyed me it is always a great mistake to let a man see that he can vex you
the next afternoon i harnessed my sorrel pony to the buggy and drove down to alexander abraham bennett's as usual i took william adolphus with me for company william adolphus is my favorite among my six cats he is black with a white dickey and beautiful white paws he sat up on the seat beside me and looked far more like a gentleman than many a man i have seen in a similar position
Alexander Abraham's place was about three miles along the White Sands Road. I knew the house as soon as I came to it by its neglected appearance. It needed paint badly, the blinds were crooked and torn, weeds grew up to the very door. Plainly there was no woman about that place. Still, it was a nice house, and the barns were splendid. My father always said that when a man's barns were bigger than his house, it was a sign that his income exceeded his expenditure. So it was all right that they should be bigger, but it was all wrong that they should be trimmer and better painted. Still, thought I, what else could you expect of a woman-hater?
but alexander abraham evidently knows how to run a farm even if he is a woman-hater i remarked to william adolphus as i got out and tied the pony to the railing i had driven up to the house from the back way and now i was opposite a side door opening on the verandah i thought i might as well go to it so i tucked william adolphus under my arm and marched up the path
just as i was half way up a dog swooped around the front corner and made straight for me he was the ugliest dog i had ever seen and he didn't even bark just came silently and speedily on with a business-like eye i never stop to argue matters with a dog that doesn't bark
i know when discretion is the better part of valor firmly clasping william adolphus i ran not to the door because the dog was between me and it but to a big low-branching cherry tree at the back corner of the house i reached it in time and no more first thrusting william adolphus on to a limb above my head i scrambled up into that blessed tree without stopping to think how it might look to alexander abraham if he happened to be watching
my time for reflection came when i found myself perched half-way up the tree with william adolphus beside me william adolphus was quite calm and unruffled i can hardly say with truthfulness what i was on the contrary i admit that i felt considerably upset the dog was sitting on his haunches on the ground below watching us and it was quite plain to be seen from his leisurely manner that it was not his busy day he bared his teeth and growled when he caught my eye you look like a woman haters dog i told him i meant it for an insult but the beast took it for a compliment
then i set myself to solving the question how am i to get out of this predicament it did not seem easy to solve it shall i scream william adolphus i demanded of that intelligent animal william adolphus shook his head this is a fact and i agreed with him no i shall not scream william adolphus i said there is probably no one to hear me except alexander abraham and i have my painful doubts about his tender mercies now it is impossible to go down is it then william adolphus possible to go up i looked up
just above my head was an open window with a tolerably stout branch extending right across it shall we try that way william adolphus i asked william adolphus wasting no words began to climb the tree i followed his examples the dog ran in circles around the tree and looked lings not lawful to be uttered it probably would have been a relief to him to bark if it hadn't been so against his principles i got in by the window easily enough and found myself in a bedroom the like of which for disorder and dust and general awfulness i had never seen in all my life but i did not pause to take in details
With William Adolphus under my arm, I marched downstairs, fervently hoping I should meet no one on the way. I did not. The hall below was empty and dusty. I opened the first door I came to and walked boldly in. A man was sitting by the window, looking moodily out. I should have known him for Alexander Abraham anywhere. He had just the same uncared-for ragged appearance that the house had, and yet, like the house, it seemed that he would not be bad-looking if he were trimmed up a little. His hair looked as if it had never been combed, and his whiskers were wild in the extreme. He looked at me with blank amazement in his countenance.
where is jimmy spencer i demanded i have come to see him how did he ever let you in asked the man staring at me he didn't let me in i retorted he chased me all over the lawn and i only saved myself from being torn piecemeal by scrambling up a tree you ought to be prosecuted for keeping such a dog where is jimmy instead of answering alexander abraham began to laugh in a most unpleasant fashion trust a woman for getting into a man's house if she is made up her mind to he said disagreeably
seeing that it was his intention to vex me i remained cool and collected oh i wasn't particular about getting into your house mr bennet i said calmly i had but little choice in the matter it was get in lest a worse fate befall me it was not you or your house i wanted to see though i admit that it is worth seeing if a person is anxious to find out how dirty a place can be it was jimmy for the third and last time where is jimmy jimmy is not here said mr bennet gruffly but not quite so assuredly he left last week
hired with a man over at newbridge in that case i said picking up william adolphus who had been exploring the room with a disdainful air i won't disturb you any longer i shall go yes i think it would be the wisest thing said alexander abraham not disagreeably this time but reflectively as if there was some doubt about the matter i'll let you out by the back door then the the dog will not interfere with you please go away quietly and quickly
i wondered if alexander abraham thought i would go away with a whoop but i said nothing thinking this the most dignified course of conduct and i followed him out to the kitchen as quickly and quietly as he could have wished such a kitchen alexander abraham opened the door which was locked just as a buggy containing two men drove into the yard too late
he exclaimed in a tragic tone i understood that something dreadful must have happened but i did not care since as i fondly supposed it did not concern me i pushed out past alexander abraham who was looking as guilty as if he had been caught burglarizing and came face to face with the man who had sprung from the buggy it was old dr blair from carmody and he was looking at me as if he had found me shoplifting my dear peter he said gravely i am very sorry to see you here very sorry indeed
i admit that this exasperated me besides no man on earth not even my own family doctor has any right to my dear peter me there is no loud call for sorrow doctor i said loftily if a woman forty-eight years of age a member of the presbyterian church in good and regular standing cannot call upon one of her sunday-school callers without wrecking all of the proprieties how old must she be before she can the doctor did not answer my question instead he looked reproachfully at alexander abraham is this how you keep your word mr bennett
he said i thought that you promised me that you would not let any one into the house i didn't let her in growled mr bennett good heavens man she climbed in at an upstairs window despite the presence on my grounds of a policeman and a dog what is to be done with a woman like that
i do not understand what all this means i said addressing myself to the doctor and ignoring alexander abraham entirely but if my presence here is so extremely inconvenient to all concerned you can soon be relieved of it i am going at once i am very sorry my dear peter said the doctor impressively but that is just what i cannot allow you to do this house is under quarantine for small-pox you will have to stay here
smallpox for the first and last time in my life i openly lost my temper with a man i wheeled furiously upon alexander abraham why didn't you tell me i cried tell you he said glaring at me when i first saw you it was too late to tell you i thought the kindest thing i could do was to hold my tongue and let you get away in happy ignorance this will teach you to take a man's house by storm madam now now
don't quarrel my good people interposed the doctor seriously but i saw a twinkle in his eye you'll have to spend some time together under the same roof and you won't improve the situation by disagreeing you see peter it was this way mr bennett was in town yesterday where as you are aware there is a bad outbreak of small-pox and took dinner in a boarding-house where one of the maids was ill
last night she developed unmistakable symptoms of smallpox the board of health at once got after all the people who were in the house yesterday so far as they could locate them and put them under quarantine i came down here this morning and explained the matter to mr bennett i brought jeremiah jeffries to guard the front of the house and mr bennett gave me his word of honor
that he would not let any one in by the back way while i went to get another policeman and make all the necessary arrangements i have brought thomas wright and have secured the services of another man to attend to mr bennett's barn-work and bring provisions to the house jacob green and cleophas lee will watch at night i don't think there is much danger of mr bennett's taking the small-pox
but until we are sure you must remain here peter while listening to the doctor i had been thinking it was the most distressing predicament i had ever got into in my life but there was no sense in making it worse very well doctor i said calmly yes i was vaccinated a month ago when the news of the smallpox first came when you go back there avonlea kindly go to sara pie and ask her to live in my house during my absence and look after things especially the cats tell her to give them new milk twice a day and a square inch of butter apiece once a week
get her to put my two dark print wrappers some aprons and some changes of underclothing in my third best valise and have it sent down to me my pony is tied out there to the fence please take him home that is all i think no it isn't all said alexander abraham grumpily send that cat home too i won't have a cat around the place i'd rather have smallpox
i looked alexander abraham over gradually in a way i have beginning at his feet and travelling up to his head i took my time over it and then i said very quietly you may have both anyhow you'll have to have william adolphus he is under quarantine as well as you and i do you suppose i am going to have my cat ranging at large through avonlea scattering small-pox germs among innocent people i'll have to put up with that dog of yours you will have to endure william adolphus alexander abraham groaned but i could see that the way i had looked him over had chastened him considerably
the doctor drove away and i went into the house not choosing to linger outside and be grinned at by thomas wright i hung my coat up in the hall and laid my bonnet carefully on the sitting-room table having first dusted a clean place for it with my handkerchief i longed to fall upon that house at once and clean it up but i had to wait until the doctor came back with my wrapper i could not clean a house in my new suit and a silk shirt-waist alexander abraham was sitting on a chair looking at me presently he said i am not curious
but will you kindly tell me why the doctor called you peter because that is my name i suppose i answered shaking up a cushion for william adolphus and thereby disturbing the dust of years alexander abraham coughed gently isn't that rather a peculiar name for a woman it is i said wondering how much soap if any there was in the house i am not curious said alexander abraham
but would you mind telling me how you came to be called peter if i had been a boy my parents intended to call me peter in honor of a rich uncle when i fortunately turned out to be a girl my mother insisted that i should be called angelina they gave me both names and called me angelina but as soon as i grew old enough i decided to be called peter it was bad enough but not so bad as angelina i should say it was more appropriate said alexander abraham intending as i perceived to be disagreeable
precisely i agreed calmly my last name is mcpherson and i live in avonlea as you are not curious that will be all the information you will need about me oh alexander abraham looked as if a light had broken in on him i've heard of you you ah pretend to dislike men pretend goodness only knows what would have happened to alexander abraham just then if a diversion had not taken place but the door opened and a dog came in the dog
i suppose he had got tired of waiting under the cherry tree for william adolphus and me to come down he was even uglier indoors than out ah mr riley mr riley see what you have let me in for said alexander abraham reproachfully but mr riley since that was the brute's name paid no attention to alexander abraham he had caught sight of william adolphus curled up on the cushion and he started across the room to investigate him william adolphus sat up and began to take notice
call off that dog i said warningly to alexander abraham call him off yourself he retorted since you've brought that cat here you can protect him oh it wasn't for william adolphus's sake i spoke i said pleasantly william adolphus can protect himself william adolphus could and did he humped his back flattened his ears swore once and then made a flying leap for mr riley william adolphus landed squarely on mr riley's brindled black
and promptly took fast hold spitting and clawing and caterwaddling you never saw a more astonished dog than mr riley with a yell of terror he bolted out of the kitchen into the hall through the hall into the room and so into the kitchen and round again with each circuit he went faster and faster until he looked like a brindled streak with a dash of black and white on top such a racket and commotion i never heard and i laughed until the tears came into my eyes mr riley flew around and around and william adolphus held on grimly and clawed alexander abraham turned purple with rage
woman call off that infernal cat before he kills my dog he shouted above the din of yelps and yowls oh he won't kill him i said reassuringly and he's going too fast to hear me if i did call him if you can stop the dog mr bennett i'll guarantee to make william adolphus listen to reason but there's no use trying to argue with a lightning flash alexander abraham made a frantic lunge at the brindled streak as it whirled past him with the result that he overbalanced himself and went sprawling on the floor with a crash
i ran to help him up which only seemed to enrage him further woman he spluttered viciously i wish you and your fiend of a cat were in in in avonlea i finished quickly to save alexander abraham from committing profanity so do i mr bennet with all my heart but since we are not let us make the best of it like sensible people and in the future you will kindly remember that my name is miss macpherson not woman
with this the end came and i was thankful for the noise those two animals made was so terrific that i expected the policeman would be rushing in a small-pox or no small-pox to see if alexander abraham and i were trying to murder each other mr riley suddenly veered in his mad career and bolted into a dark corner between the stove and the wood-box and william adolphus let go just in time there never was any more trouble with mr riley after that a meeker more thoroughly chastened dog you could not find william adolphus had the best of it and he kept it
seeing that things had calmed down and that it was five o'clock i decided to get tea i told alexander abraham that i would prepare it if he would show me where the eatables were you needn't mind said alexander abraham i've been in the habit of getting my own tea for twenty years i dare say but you haven't been in the habit of getting mine i said firmly i wouldn't eat anything you cooked if i starved to death if you want some occupation you'd better get some salve and anoint the scratches on that poor dog's back
alexander abraham said something that i prudently did not hear seeing that he had no information to hand out i went on an exploring expedition into the pantry the place was awful beyond description and for the first time a vague sentiment of pity for alexander abraham glimmered in my breast when a man had to live in such surroundings the wonder was not that he hated women but that he didn't hate the whole human race but i got up a supper somehow i am noted for getting up suppers
the bread was from the carmody bakery and i made good tea and excellent toast besides i found a can of peaches in the pantry which as they were bought i wasn't afraid to eat the tea and toast mellowed out alexander abraham in spite of himself he ate the last crust and didn't growl when i gave william adolphus all the cream that was left mr riley did not seem to want anything he had no appetite by this time the doctor's boy had arrived with my valise alexander abraham gave me quite civilly to understand that there was a spare room across the hall and that i might take possession of it i went to it and put on a wrapper
there was a set of fine furniture in the room and a comfortable bed but the dust william adolphus had followed me in and his paws left marks everywhere he walked now i said briskly returning to the kitchen i am going to clean up and i shall begin with this kitchen you better betake yourself to the sitting-room mr bennett so as to be out of the way alexander abraham glared at me i'm not going to have my house meddled with he snapped it suits me if you don't like it you can leave it
no i can't that is just the trouble i said pleasantly if i could leave it i shouldn't be here for a minute since i can't it simply has to be cleaned i can tolerate men and dogs when i am compelled to but i cannot and will not tolerate dirt and disorder go into the sitting-room alexander abraham went as he closed the door i heard him say in capitals what an awful woman
i cleared that kitchen and the pantry adjoining it was ten o'clock when i got through and alexander abraham had gone to bed without deigning further speech i locked mr riley in one room and william adolphus in another and went to bed too i had never felt so dead tired in my life before it had been a hard day
but i got up bright and early the next morning and got a tip-top breakfast which alexander abraham condescended to eat when the provision man came into the yard i called to him from the window to bring me a box of soap in the afternoon and then i tackled the sitting-room it took me the best part of a week to get the house in order but i did it thoroughly i am noted for doing things thoroughly at the end of the time it was clean from garret to silt
alexander abraham made no comments on my operations though he groaned loud and often and said caustic things to poor mr riley who hadn't the spirit to answer back after his drubbing by william
i made allowance for alexander abraham because his vaccination had been taken and his arm was real sore and i cooked elegant meals not having much else to do once i had got things scoured up the house was full of provisions alexander abraham wasn't mean about such things i will say that for him altogether i was more comfortable than i had expected to be when alexander abraham wouldn't talk i let him alone and when he would i just said as sarcastic things as he did only i said them smiling and pleasant
I could see he had a wholesome awe for me, but now and then he seemed to forget his disposition and talk like a human being. We had one or two real interesting conversations. Alexander Abraham was an intelligent man, though he had got terribly warped. I told him once I thought he might have been nice when he was a boy. One day he astonished me by appearing at the dinner table with his hair brushed and a white collar on. We had a tip-top dinner that day, and I had made a pudding that was far too good for a woman hater. When Alexander Abraham had disposed of two large platefuls of it, he sighed and said,
you can certainly cook it's a pity you are such a detestable crank in other respects it's kind of convenient being a crank i said people are careful how they meddle with you haven't you found that out in your own experience i am not a crank growled alexander abraham resentfully all i ask is to be let alone that's the very crankiest kind of crank i said
a person who wants to be let alone flies in the face of providence who decreed that folks for their own good were not to be let alone but cheer up mr bennett the quarantine will be up on tuesday and then you'll certainly be let alone for the rest of your natural life as far as william adolphus and i are concerned you may then return to your wallowing in the mire and be as dirty and comfortable as of yore alexander abraham growled again the prospect didn't seem to cheer him up as much as i should have expected then he did an amazing thing he poured some cream into a saucer and set it down before william
william at office lapped it up keeping one eye on alexander abraham lest the latter should change his mind not to be outdone i handed mr riley a bone neither alexander abraham nor i had worried much about the smallpox we didn't believe he would take it for he hadn't even seen the girl who was sick but the very next morning i heard him calling me from the upstairs landing miss macpherson he said in a voice so uncommonly mild that it gave me an uncanny feeling what are the symptoms of smallpox
chills and flushes pain in the limbs and back nausea and vomiting i answered promptly for i had been reading them up in a patent medicine almanac i've got them all said alexander abraham hollowly i didn't feel as much scared as i should have expected after enduring a woman-hater and a brindledog and the early disorder of that house and coming off best with all three smallpox seemed rather insignificant i went to the window and called to thomas rightforth to send for the doctor the doctor came down from alexander abraham's room looking grave
it's impossible to pronounce on the disease yet he said there is no certainty until the eruption appears but of course there is every likelihood that it is the smallpox it is very unfortunate i am afraid that it will be difficult to get a nurse all the nurses in town who will take smallpox cases are over busy now for the epidemic is still raging there however
i'll go into town to-night and do my best meanwhile at present you must not go near him peter i wasn't going to take orders from any man and as soon as the doctor had gone i marched straight up to alexander abraham's room with some dinner for him on a tray there was a lemon cream i thought he could eat even if he had the small-pox you shouldn't come near me he growled you are risking your life i am not going to see a fellow-creature starve to death even if he is a man i retorted the worst of it all
groaned alexander abraham between mouthfuls of lemon cream is that the doctor says i've got to have a nurse i've got so kind of use to you being in the house that i don't mind you but the thought of another woman coming here is too much did you give my poor dog anything to eat he has had a better dinner than many a christian i said severely alexander and abraham need not have worried about another woman coming in the doctor came back that night with care on his brow
i don't know what is to be done he said i can't get a soul to come here i shall nurse mr bennett i said with dignity it is my duty and i never shirk my duty i am noted for that he is a man and he has smallpox and he keeps a vile dog but i am not going to see him die for lack of care for all that you're a good soul peter said the doctor looking relieved manlike as soon as he found a woman to shoulder the responsibility
i nursed alexander abraham through this ball-pox and i didn't mind it much he was much more abiable sick than well and he had the disease in a very mild form below stairs i reigned supreme and mr riley and william adolphus lay down together like the lion and the lamb i fed mr riley regularly and once seeing him look lonesome i patted him gingerly it was nicer than i thought it would be mr riley lifted his head and looked at me with an expression in his eyes which cured me of wondering why on earth alexander abraham was so fond of the beast when alexander abraham was able to sit up
he began to make up for the time he'd lost being pleasant anything more sarcastic than that man and his convalescence you couldn't imagine i just laughed at him having found out that that could be depended on to irritate him to irritate him still further i cleaned the house all over again but what vexed him most of all was that mr riley took to following me about and wagging what he had of a tail at me it wasn't enough that you should come into my peaceful house and turn it upside down but you have to alienate the affections of my dog
complained alexander abraham he'll get fond of you again when i go home he said comfortingly dogs aren't very particular that way what they want is bones cats now they love disinterestedly william adolphus has never swerved in his allegiance to me although you do give him cream in the pantry on the sly alexander abraham looked foolish he hadn't thought i knew that i didn't take the small-pox and in another week the doctor came out and sent the policeman home i was disinfected and william adolphus was fumigated and then we were free to go
good-bye mr bennet i said offering to shake hands in a forgiving spirit i've no doubt that you are glad to be rid of me but you are no gladder than i am to go i suppose this house will be dirtier than ever in a month's time and mr riley will have discarded the little polish his manners have taken on reformation with men and dogs never goes very deep with this parthian shaft i walked out of the house supposing that i had seen the last of it and alexander abraham i was glad to get back home of course but it did seem queer and lonesome
the cats hardly knew me and william adolphus roamed about forlornly and appeared to feel like an exile i didn't take as much pleasure in cooking as usual for it seemed kind of foolish to be fussing over one's self the sight of a bone made me think of poor mr riley the neighbors avoided me pointedly for they couldn't get rid of the fear that i might erupt into smallpox at any moment my sunday-school class had been given to another woman and altogether i felt as if i didn't belong anywhere
i had existed like this for a fortnight when alexander abraham suddenly appeared he walked in one evening at dusk but at first sight i didn't know him he was so spruced and barbered up but william adolphus knew him will you believe it william adolphus my own william adolphus rubbed up against that man's trouser-leg with an undisguised purr of satisfaction i had to come angelina said alexander abraham i couldn't stand it any longer my name is peter
i said coldly although i was feeling ridiculously glad about something it isn't said alexander abraham stubbornly it is angelina for me and always will be i shall never call you peter angelina just suits you exactly and angelina bennett would suit you still better you must come back angelina mr riley is moping for you and i can't get along without somebody to appreciate my sarcasms
now that you have accustomed me to the luxury what about the other five cats i demanded alexander abraham sighed i suppose they'll have to come too he sighed though no doubt they'll chase poor mr riley clean off the premises but i can live without him and i can't without you how soon can you be ready to marry me
i haven't said that i was going to marry you at all have i i said tartly just to be consistent for i wasn't feeling tart no but you will won't you said alexander abraham anxiously because if you won't i wish you'd let me die of the smallpox do dear angelina to think that a man should dare to call me his dear angelina and to think that i shouldn't mind where i go william adolphus goes i said but i shall give away the other five cats for-for the sake of mr riley

henry morgan read by benjamin tucker pedro surita by scott calkins raphael read by wayne cook ignacio read by laurie wilson augustina read by jim locke gendarme read by todd chapter v of hearts of three by jack london it was in the mid-afternoon
and henry at his barred cell window stared out into the street and wondered if any sort of breeze would ever begin to blow off of chiriqui lagoon and cool the stagnant air the street was dusty and filthy filthy because the only scavengers it had ever known since the town was founded centuries before were the carrion dogs and obscene buzzards even then prowling and hopping about in the debris
low whitewashed buildings of stone and adobe made the street a furnace the white of it all and the dust was almost achingly intolerable to the eyes and henry would have withdrawn his gaze had not the several ragged mozos dozing in a doorway opposite suddenly aroused and looked interestedly up the street henry could not see but he could hear the rattling spokes of some vehicle coming at speed
next it surged into view a rattle-trap light wagon drawn by a runaway horse in the seat a gray-headed gray-bearded ancient strove vainly to check the animal henry smiled and marveled that the rickety wagon could hold together so prodigious were the bumps imparted to it by the deep ruts every wheel half dished and threatening to dish wobbled and revolved out of line with every other wheel
and if the wagon held intact henry judged it was a miracle that the crazy harness did not fly to pieces when directly opposite the window the old man made a last effort half standing up from the seat as he pulled on the reins one was rotten and broke as the driver fell backward into the seat his weight on the remaining rein caused the horse to swerve sharply to the right what happened then
whether a wheel dished or whether a wheel had come off first and dished afterward henry could not determine the one incontestable thing was that the wagon was a wreck the old man dragging in the dust and stubbornly hanging on to the remaining rein swung the horse in a circle until it stopped facing him and snorting at him by the time he gained his feet a crowd of mozos was forming about him
these were roughly shouldered right and left by the gendarmes who erupted from the jail henry remained at the window and for a man with but a few hours to live was an amused spectator and listener to what followed giving his horse to a gendarme to hold not stopping to brush the filth from his person the old man limped hurriedly to the wagon and began an examination of the several packing cases large and small
which composed its load of one case he was especially solicitous even trying to lift it and seeming to listen as he lifted he straightened up on being addressed by one of the gendarmes and made voluble reply me alas seors i am an old man and far from home i am leopoldo narvaez it is true my mother was german may the saints preserve her rest
but my father was btizar de jesus e corvallis e narvaez son of general narvaez of martial memory who fought under the great bolivar himself and now i am half ruined and far from home prompted by other questions interlarded with the courteous expressions of sympathy with which even the humblest mozo is over-generously supplied
he managed to be politely grateful and to run on with his tale i have driven from bogas del toro it has taken me five days and business has been poor my home is in cologne and i wish i were safely there but even a noble narvaez may be a pedlar and even a pedlar must live eh seons is it not so but tell me is there not a tomas
who dwells in this pleasant city of san antonio there are any god's number of tomas romeros who dwell everywhere in panama laughed pedro zurita the assistant jailer one would need a fuller description he is the cousin of my second wife the ancient answered hopefully and seemed bewildered by the roar of laughter from the crowd and a dozen tomas romeros live in and about san antonio
the assistant jailer went on any one of which may be your second wife's cousin signor there is tomas romero the drunkard there is tomas romero the thief there is tomas romero but no he was hanged a month back for murder and robbery there is the rich tomas romero who owns many cattle on the hills there is-to each suggested one leopoldo narvaez had shaken his head dolefully until the cattle owner was mentioned
at this he had become hopeful and broken pardon me seor it must be he or some such a one as he i shall find him if my precious stock in trade can be safely stored i shall seek him now it is well my misfortune came upon me where it did i shall be able to trust it with you who are one can see with half an eye an honest and an honourable man as he talked
he fumbled forth from his pocket two silver pesos and handed them to the jailer there i wish you and your men to have some pleasure of assisting me henry grinned to himself as he noted the access of interest in the old man and of consideration for him on the part of pedro zurita and the gendarmes caused by the present of the coins
they shoved the more curious of the crowd roughly back from the wrecked wagon and began to carry the boxes into the jail careful seors careful the old one pleaded greatly anxious as they took hold of the big box handle it gently it is of value and it is fragile most fragile while the contents of the wagon were being carried into the jail
the old man removed and deposited in the wagon all harness from the horse save the bridle pedro zurita ordered the harness taken in as well explaining with a glare at the miserable crowd not a strap or buckle would remain the second after our backs were turned using what was left of the wagon for a stepping-block and ably assisted by the jailer and his crew the pedlar managed to get astride his animal it is well he said
and added gratefully a thousand thanks seors it has been my good fortune to meet with honest men with whom my goods will be safe only poor goods peddlers goods you understand but to me everything my way upon the road the pleasure has been mine to meet you to-morrow i shall return with my kinsmen whom i certainly shall find and relieve from you the burden
of safeguarding my inconsiderable property he doffed his hat adios senors adios he rode away at a careful walk timid of the animal he bestrode which had caused his catastrophe he halted and turned his head at a call from pedro search the graveyard senor narvaez the jailer advised full a hundred tomas romeros lie there and be vigilant
i beg of you seor of the heavy box the pedlar called back henry watched the street grow deserted as the gendarmes and the populace fled from the scorch of the sun small wonder he thought to himself that the old pedlar's voice had sounded vaguely familiar it had been because he had possessed only half a spanish tongue to twist around the language the other half being the german tongue of the mother
even so he talked like a native and he would be robbed like a native if there was anything of value in the heavy box deposited with the jailers henry concluded ere dismissing the incident from his mind in the guard-room a scant fifty feet away from henry's cell leopoldo narvaez was being robbed it had begun by pedro zurita making a profound and wistful survey of the large box he lifted one end of it to sample its weight
and sniffed like a hound at the crack of it as if his nose might give him some message of its contents leave that alone pedro one of the gendarmes laughed at him you have been paid two pesos to be honest the assistant jailer sighed walked away and sat down looked back at the box and sighed again conversation languished continually the eyes of the men roved to the box
a greasy pack of cards could not divert them the game languished the gendarme who had twitted pedro himself went to the box and sniffed i smell nothing he announced absolutely in the box there is nothing to smell now what can it be the caballero said it was of value caballero sniffed another of the gendarmes the old man's father
was more like to have been peddler of rotten fish on the streets of cologne and his father before him every lying beggar claims descent from the conquistadors and why not raphael pedro zurita retorted are we not all so descended without doubt raphael readily agreed the conquistadores slew many and were the ancestors of those that survived
pedro completed for him and aroused a general laugh just the same almost would i give one of these pesos to know what is in that box that is ignacio raphael greeted the entrance of a turnkey whose heavy eyes tokened he was just out of his siesta he was not paid to be honest come ignacio relieve our curiosity by letting us know what is in the box how should i know
inacio demanded blinking at the object of interest only now i have awakened you have not been paid to be honest then rafael asked merciful mother of god who is the man who would pay me to be honest the turnkey demanded then take the hatchet there and open the box rafael drove his point home we may not for as surely as pedro is to share the two pesos with us
that surely we have been paid to be honest open the box ignacio or we shall perish of our curiosity we will look we will only look pedro muttered nervously as the turnkey prized off a board with the blade of the hatchet then we will close the box again and put your hand in ignacio what is it you find eh what does it feel like ah after pulling and tugging ignacio's hand had reappeared
clutching a cardboard carton remove it carefully for it must be replaced the jailer cautioned and when the wrappings of paper and tissue paper were removed all eyes focused on a quart bottle of rye whisky how excellently is it composed pedro murmured in tones of awe it must be very good that such care be taken of it it is americano whisky sighed
once only have i drunk americano whisky it was wonderful such was the courage of it that i leaped into the bull-ring at santos and faced a wild bull with my hands it is true the bull rolled me but did i not leap into the ring pedro took the bottle and prepared to knock its neck off hold cried raphael you were a babe to be honest
by a man who was not himself honest came the retort the stuff is contraband it has never paid duty the old man was in possession of smuggled goods let us now gratefully and with clear conscience invest ourselves in its possession we will confiscate it we will destroy it not waiting for the bottle to pass ignacio and rafael unwrapped fresh ones and broke off the necks three stars most excellent
pedro zurita orated in a pause pointing to the trade-mark you see all gringo whisky is good one star shows that it is very good two stars that it is excellent three stars that it is superb the best and better than beyond that ah i know the gringos are strong on strong drink no pulque for them and for stars queried
his voice husky from the liquor the moisture glistening in his eyes four stars friend ignacio four stars would be either sudden death or translation into paradise in not many minutes raphael his arm around another endarme was calling him brother and proclaiming that it took little to make men happy here below the old man was a fool three times a fool and thrice that
volunteered agostino a sullen-faced gendarme who for the first time gave tongue to speech viva agostino cheered raphael the three stars have worked a miracle behold have they not unlocked agostino's mouth and thrice times thrice again was the old man a fool agostino bellowed fiercely
the very drink of the gods was his all his and he has been five days alone with it on the road from boscas del toro and never taken one little sip such fools as he should be stretched out naked on an ant-heap say i the old man was a rogue quoth pedro and when he comes back to-morrow for his three stars i shall arrest him for a smuggler it will be a feather in all our caps if we destroy the evidence thus
queried agostino knocking off another neck we will save the evidence thus pedro replied smashing an empty bottle on the stone flags listen comrades the box was very heavy we are all agreed it fell the bottles broke the liquor ran out and so were we made aware of the contraband the box and the broken bottles will be evidence sufficient the uproar grew as the liquor diminished
one endarme quarrelled with ignacio over a forgotten debt of ten centavos two others sat upon the floor arms around each other's necks and wept over the miseries of their married lot augustino like a very spendthrift of speech explained his philosophy that silence was golden and pedro zurita became sentimental on brotherhood even my prisoners he mondered i love them as brothers
life is sad a gush of tears in his eyes made him desist while he took another drink my prisoners are my very children my heart bleeds for them behold i weep let us share with them let them have a moment's happiness ignacio dearest brother of my heart do me a favour see i weep on your hand carry a bottle of this elixir to the gringo morgan
tell him my sorrow that he must hang to-morrow give him my love and bid him drink and be happy to-day and as ignacio passed out on the errand the gendarme who had once leapt into the bull-ring at santos began roaring i want a pole i want a pole he wants it dear soul that he may put his arms around it and love it pedro zurita explained
with the fresh access of weeping i too love bulls i love all things i love even mosquitoes all the world is love that is the secret of the world i should like to have a lion to play with the unmistakable air of back to back against the mainmast being whistled openly in the street caught henry's attention and he was crossing his big cell to the window
when the grating of a key in the door made him lie down quickly on the floor and feign sleep ignacio staggered drunkenly in bottle in hand which he gravely presented to henry with the high compliments of our good jailer pedro zurita he mumbled he says to drink and forget that he must stretch your neck to-morrow my high compliments to seor pedro
and tell him from me to go to hell along with his whiskey henry replied the turnkey straightened up and ceased swaying as if suddenly become sober very well seor he said then passed out and locked the door in a rush henry was at the window just in time to encounter francis face to face and thrusting a revolver to him through the bars greetings camarada francis said
we'll have you out of here in a jiffy he held up two sticks of dynamite with fuse and caps complete i have brought this pretty crowbar to pry you out stand well back in your cell because real pronto there's going to be a hole in this wall that we could sail the angelique through and the angelique is right off the beach waiting for you now stand back i'm going to touch her off it's a short fuse
hardly had henry backed into a rear corner of his cell when the door was clumsily unlocked and opened to a babel of cries and imprecations chiefest among which he could hear the ancient and invariable war-cry of latin america kill the gringo also he could hear rafael and pedro as they entered babbling the one he is the enemy of brotherly love and the other he said i was to go to hell
is not that what he said ignacio in their hands they carried rifles and behind them urged the drunken rabble variously armed from cutlasses and horse-pistols to hatchets and bottles at sight of henry's revolver they halted and pedro fingering his rifle unsteadily mondered solemnly signor morgan you are about to take up your rightful abode in hell but ignacio did not wait
he fired wildly and widely from his hip missing henry by half the width of the cell and going down the next moment under the impact of henry's bullet the rest retreated precipitately into the jail corridor where themselves unseen they began discharging their weapons into the room thanking his fortunate stars for the thickness of the walls and hoping no ricochet would get him henry sheltered in a protecting angle and waited for the explosion
it came the window and the wall beneath it became all one aperture struck on the head by a flying fragment henry sank down dizzily and as the dust of the mortar and the powder cleared with wavering eyes he saw francis apparently swim through the hole by the time he had been dragged out through the hole henry was himself again he could see enrico solano and ricardo his youngest born rifles in hand
holding back the crowd forming up the street while the twins alvarado and martinez similarly held back the crowd forming down the street but the populace was merely curious having its lives to lose and nothing to gain if it attempted to block the way of such masterful men as these who blew up walls and stormed jails in open day and it gave back respectfully before the compact group as it marched down the street
the horses are waiting up the next alley francis told henry as they gripped hands and leonicia is waiting with them fifteen minutes gallop will take us to the beach where the boat is waiting say that was some song i taught you henry grinned it sounded like the very best little bit of all right when i heard you whistling it the dogs were so previous they couldn't wait till to-morrow to hang me they got full of whiskey and decided to finish me off right away
funny thing that whisky an old caballero turned peddler wrecked a wagon-load of it right in front of the jail for even a noble narvaez son of balthazar de jesus carvalhos et narvaez son of general narvaez of martial memory may be a peddler and even a peddler must live eh seons is it not so frances mimicked
henry looked his gleeful recognition and added soberly francis i'm glad for one thing most damn glad which is francis queried in the pause just as they swung around the corner to the horses that i didn't cut off your ears that day on the calf when i had you down and you insisted chapter five of hearts of three by jack london

read by lynette calkins elphie read by eliza yuletide london at yuletide a mantle of white lay upon the embankment where our story opens gleaming and glistening as it caught the rays of the cold december sun an embroidery of white fringed the trees
and under a canopy of white the proud palaces of savoy and cecil reared their silent heads the mighty river in front was motionless for the finger of death had laid its icy hand upon it above the hard blue sky stretching to eternity below the white purity of innocence london in the grip of winter
i like this this is going to be good a cold day was it not very all at once the quiet of the morning was disturbed in the distance a bell rang out sending a joyous pain to the heavens another took up the word and then another and another westminster caught the message from bartholomew the son of thunder and flung it to giles without
who gave it gently to andrew by the wardrobe suddenly the air was filled with bells all chanting together of peace and happiness mirth and jollity a frenzy of bells the duke father of four fine children waking in his highland castle heard and smiled as he thought of his little ones the merchant prince
turning over in his magnificent residence heard and turned again to sleep with love for all mankind in his heart the papa in his workhouse up betimes heard and chuckled at the prospect of his christmas dinner and on the embankment robert hardrow with a cynical smile on his lips listened to the splendid irony of it
we really are getting to the story now are we not that was all local colour i want to make it quite clear that it was christmas yes yes quite so this is certainly a christmas story i think i shall like robert do you know it was christmas day so much at least was clear to him with that same cynical smile on his lips he pulled his shivering rags about him
and half unconsciously felt at the growth of beard about his chin nobody would recognize him now his friends as he had thought them would pass by without a glance for the poor outcast to near them the women that he had known would draw their skirts away from him in horror even lady alice lady alice the cause of it all his thoughts flew back to that last scene but twenty-four hours ago
when they had parted for ever as he had entered the hall he had half wondered to himself if there could be anybody in the world that day happier than himself tall well connected vice-president of the tariff reform league and engaged to the sweetest girl in england he had been the envy of all little did he think that that very night he was to receive his congee
what mattered it now how or why they had quarrelled a few hasty words bitter taunt tears and then the end a last cry from her go and let me never see your face again a last sneer from him i will go but first give me back the presents i have promised you then the slammed door and silence what use without her guidance
to try to keep straight any more bereft of her love robert had sunk steadily gambling drink morphia billiards and cigars he had taken to them all until now in the wretched figure of the outcast on the embankment you would never have recognised the one spruce figure of hansom hardrow it all seems to have happened rather rapidly does it not twenty-four hours ago
he had been you forget this is a short story handsome hardro how absurd it sounded now he had let his beard grow his clothes were in rags a scar over one eye testified yes yes of course i quite admit that a man might go to the bad in twenty-four hours but would his beard grow as look here you've heard of a man going grey with trouble in a single night haven't you certainly
well it's the same idea as that ah quite so quite so where was i a scar over one eye was just testifying i suppose he had two eyes in the ordinary way testified to a drunken frolic of an hour or two ago never before thought the policeman as he passed upon his beat had such a pitiful figure cowered upon the embankment and prayed for the night to cover him
the he was er the yes to tell the truth i'm rather stuck for the moment what is the trouble i don't quite know what to do with robert for ten hours or so couldn't he go somewhere by a local line this is not a humorous story
the point is that i want him to be outside a certain house some twenty miles from town at eight o'clock that evening if i were robert i should certainly start at once no i have it as he sat there his thoughts flew over the bridge of years and he was wafted on the wings of memory to other and happier yuletides that christmas when he had received his first bicycle
that christmas abroad the merry house-party at the place of his cambridge friend yuletide at the towers where he had first met alice ah ten hours passed rapidly thus i put stars to denote the flight of years besides it will give the reader time for a sandwich robert got up and shook himself one moment
this is a christmas story where are you coming to the robin i really can't be bothered about robins just now i assure you that all the best christmas stories begin like this nowadays we may get to a robin later i cannot say we must my readers expect a robin and they shall have it in a wassail bowl in a turkey and a christmas tree
and a yes yes but wait we'll come to little elsie soon and then perhaps it will be all right little elsie good robert got up and shook himself then he shivered miserably as the cold wind cut through him like a knife for a moment he stood motionless gazing over the stone parapet into the dark river beyond and as he gazed a thought came into his mind why not end it all
here and now he has nothing to live for one swift plunge and you forget the river was frozen dash it i was just going to say that but no even in this fate was against him the river was frozen over he turned away with a curse what happened afterwards robert never quite understood
almost unconsciously he must have crossed one of the numerous bridges which span the river and join north london to south once on the other side he seemed to have set his face steadily before him and to have dragged his weary limbs on and on regardless of time and place he walked like one in a dream his mind drudged by the dull narcotic of physical pain suddenly he realized that he had left london behind him
and was in the more open spaces of the country the houses were more scattered the recurring villa of the clerk had given place to the isolated mansion of the stockbroker each residence stood in its own splendid grounds surrounded by the fine old forest trees and approached by long carriage sweep electric quite so the whole forming a magnificent estate for a retired gentleman
never mind that robert stood at the entrance to one of these houses and the iron entered into his soul how different was this man's position from his own what right had this man a perfect stranger to be happy and contented in the heart of his family while he robert stood a homeless wanderer alone in the coal almost unconsciously he wandered down the drive
hardly realizing what he was doing until he was brought up by the gay lights of the windows still without thinking he stooped down and peered into the brilliantly lit room above him within all was jollity beautiful women moved to and fro and the happy laughter of children came to him elsie he heard some one call and a childish treble responded now for the robin
i am very sorry i have just remembered something rather sad the fact is that two days before elsie had forgotten to feed the robin and in consequence it had died before the story opens that is really very awkward i have already arranged with an artist to do some pictures and i remember i particularly ordered a robin and a wassail what about the wassail
elsie always has her porridge upstairs a terrible thought had come into robert's head it was nearly twelve o'clock the house-party was retiring to bed he heard the good-nights wafted through the open window the lights went out to reappear upstairs presently they too went out and robert was alone with the darkened house
the temptation was too much for a conscience already sodden with billiards golf and cigars he flung a leg over the sill and drew himself gently into the room at least he would have one good meal he too would have his christmas dinner before the end came he switched the light on and turned eagerly to the table his eyes ravenously scanned the contents turkey mince pies plum pudding
all was there as in the days of his youth this is better i ordered a turkey i remember what about the mistletoe and holly rather think i asked for some of them we must let the readers take something for granted i am not so sure couldn't you say something like this holly and mistletoe hung in the festoons upon the wall
indeed even holly and mistletoe hung in festoons upon the wall thank you with a sigh of content hardro flung himself into a chair and sieved a knife and fork soon a plate liberally heaped with good things was before him greedily he set to work with the appetite of a man who had not tasted food for several hours good evening said a voice are you father
robert turned suddenly and gazed in amazement at the white-robed figure in the doorway elsie he murmured huskily how did he know and why huskily he didn't know he guessed and his mouth was full are you father christmas repeated elsie robert felt his chin and thanked heaven again that he had let his beard grow almost mechanically he decided to wear the mask
in short to dissemble yes my dear he said i just looked in to know what you would like me to bring you you're late aren't you why didn't you two have come this morning this is splendid this quite reconciles me to the absence of the robin but what was elsie doing downstairs i'm making robert ask her that question directly yes but just tell me now
between friends she had left her golliwog in the room and couldn't sleep without it i knew that was it if i'm late dear said robert with a smile why so are you and the good food and wine in his veins were doing their work and a pleasant warmth was stealing over hardro he found to his surprise that airy banter still came easily to him to what he continued
do i owe the honour of this meeting i came downstairs for my dolly said elsie the one you sent me this morning do you remember of course i do my dear what have you bought me now father christmas robert started if he was to play the rle successfully he must find something to give her now the remains of the turkey a pair of finger-bowls his old hat
all these came hastily into his mind and were dismissed he had nothing of value on him all had been pawned long ago stay the gold locket studded with diamonds and rubies which contained alice's photograph the one memento of her that he had kept even when the pangs of starvation were upon him he brought it from its resting-place next to his heart
a little something to wear round your neck child he said see thank oo said elsie opens yes it opens said robert moodily why it's alice ha i thought you'd like that robert leaped to his feet as if he'd been shot who he cried my sister alice does oo know her too alice's sister heavens
he covered his face with his hands the door opened ha again what are you doing here elsie said a voice go to bed child why who is this father christmas mr how exactly do you work the lisping what do you mean don't children of elsie's tender years lisp sometimes yes but just now she said
quite correctly i am glad you noticed that that was an effect which i intended to produce lisping is brought about by placing the tongue upon the hard surface of the palate and in cases where the subject is unduly excited or influenced by emotion the lisp becomes more pronounced in this case jeff i fee send her away cried robert without raising his head
the door opened and closed again well said alice calmly and who are you you may have lied to this poor child but you cannot deceive me you are not father christmas the miserable man raised his shamefaced head and looked haggardly at her alice he muttered don't you remember me she gazed at him earnestly robert
how changed since we parted alice much has happened yet it seems only yesterday that i saw you it was only yesterday yes yes don't interrupt now please to me it has seemed years but what are you doing here said alice rather what are you doing here answered robert
i think alice's question was the more reasonable one i live here robert gave a sudden cry your house then i have broken into your house alice send me away put me in prison do what you will to me i can never hold up my head again lady alice looked gently at the wretched figure in front of her i am glad to see you again she said because
i wanted to say that it was my fault alice can you forgive me forgive you if you knew what my life has been since i left you if you knew into what paths of wickedness i have sunk how only this evening unnerved by excess i have deliberately broken into this house your house in order to obtain food already i have eaten more than half a turkey and the best part of a plum-pudding
i with a gesture of infinite compassion she stopped him then let us forgive each other she said with a smile a new year is beginning robert he took her in his arms listen he said in the distance the bells began to ring in the new year a message of hope to all weary travellers on life's highway it was new year's day
i thought christmas day had started on the embankment this would be boxing day i'm sorry but it must end like that i must have my bells that's all very well i have a good deal to explain as it is some of your story doesn't fit the pictures at all and it is too late now to get new ones done i am afraid i cannot work to order
yes i know the artist said the same thing well i must manage somehow i suppose good-bye rotten weather for august isn't it the making of a christmas story by a a milne
